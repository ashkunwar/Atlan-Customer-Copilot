    "title": "Set up Microsoft Power BI | Atlan Documentation",
    "content": "Connect data BI Tools On-premises & Enterprise BI Microsoft Power BI Get Started Set up Microsoft Power BI On this page Set up Microsoft Power BI Who can do this? Depending on the authentication method you choose, you may need a combination of your Cloud Application Administrator or Application Administrator for Microsoft Entra ID, Microsoft 365 administrator for Microsoft 365, and Fabric Administrator ( formerly known as Power BI Administrator ) for Microsoft Power BI to complete these tasks -> you may not have access yourself. This guide outlines how to set up Microsoft Power BI so it can connect with Atlan for metadata extraction and lineage tracking. Before you begin ​ Register application in Microsoft Entra ID ​ Who can do this? You need your Cloud Application Administrator or Application Administrator to complete these steps—> you may not have access yourself. This is required if the creation of registered applications isn't enabled for the entire organization. To register a new application in Microsoft Entra ID: Log in to the Azure portal . Search for Microsoft Entra ID and select it. Click App registrations from the left . Click + New registration . Enter a name for your client application and click Register . From the Overview screen, copy and securely store: Application (client) ID Directory (tenant) ID Click Certificates & secrets from the left . Under Client secrets , click + New client secret . Enter a description, select an expiry time, and click Add . Copy and securely store the client secret Value . Create security group in Microsoft Entra ID ​ Who can do this? You need your Cloud Application Administrator or Application Administrator to complete these steps - you may not have access yourself. To create a security group for your application: Log in to the Azure portal . Search for Microsoft Entra ID and select it. Click Groups under the Manage section. Click New group . Set the Group type to Security . Enter a Group name and optional description. Click No members selected . Add the appropriate member: For Delegated User authentication : search for the user and select it. For Service Principal authentication : search for the application registration created earlier and select it. Click Select and then Create . By the end of these steps, you have registered an application with Microsoft Entra ID and created a Security Group with the appropriate member. Configure authentication options ​ Atlan supports two authentication methods for fetching metadata from Microsoft Power BI: Service principal authentication (recommended) ​ When using Service Principal authentication, you must decide how the connector shall access metadata to catalog assets and build lineage. There are two supported options: Admin API only ​ This option grants permissions that let the service principal to access only admin-level Power BI APIs. In this mode, Atlan extracts metadata exclusively using administrative endpoints. This option is recommended for stricter access control environments. Who can do this? You need your Fabric Administrator ( formerly known as Power BI Administrator ) to complete these tasks - you may not have access yourself. To configure admin API access: Log in to the Power BI admin portal . Click Tenant settings under Admin portal. Under Admin API settings : Expand Enable service principals to use read-only Power BI admin APIs and set to Enabled Add your security group under Specific security groups Click Apply Expand Enhance admin APIs responses with detailed metadata and set to Enabled Add your security group Click Apply Expand Enhance admin APIs responses with DAX and mashup expressions and set to Enabled Add your security group Click Apply Admin and non-admin APIs ​ This option grants permissions that let the service principal to access both admin and non-admin Power BI APIs. This enables Atlan to extract richer metadata and build detailed lineage across Power BI assets. Assign security group to Power BI workspaces in PowerBI service portal ​ Who can do this? You need to be at least a member of the Microsoft Power BI workspace to which you want to add the security group to complete these steps - you may not have access yourself. Make sure that you add the security group from the page and not the admin portal. To assign a Microsoft Power BI workspace role to the security group: Open the Microsoft Power BI page . Open Workspaces and select the workspace you want to access from Atlan. Click Access . In the panel: Enter the name of your security group where it says Enter email addresses Choose one of the following roles: Viewer : For workspaces without parameters Contributor : For workspaces with semantic models containing parameters or to generate lineage for measures Member : To generate lineage for dataflows Click Add . Configure admin and non-admin API access in PowerBI Service Portal ​ Who can do this? You need your Fabric Administrator ( formerly known as Power BI Administrator ) to complete these tasks - you may not have access yourself. To enable both admin and non-admin API access: Log in to the Power BI admin portal . Click Tenant settings under Admin portal. Under Developer settings : Expand Service principals can use Fabric APIs and set to Enabled Add your security group under Specific security groups Click Apply Under Admin API settings : Expand Enable service principals to use read-only Power BI admin APIs and set to Enabled Add your security group Click Apply Expand Enhance admin APIs responses with detailed metadata and set to Enabled Add your security group Click Apply Expand Enhance admin APIs responses with DAX and mashup expressions and set to Enabled Add your security group Click Apply After making these changes, you typically need to wait 15-30 minutes for the settings to take effect across Microsoft's services. Delegated user authentication ​ info Atlan doesn't recommend using delegated user authentication as it's also not recommended by Microsoft. Fabric administrator role assignment ​ Who can do this? You need your Microsoft 365 administrator to complete these steps - you may not have access yourself. To assign the delegated user to the Fabric Administrator role: Open the Microsoft 365 admin portal . Click Users and then Active users from the left . Select the delegated user. Under Roles , click Manage roles . Expand Show all by category . Under Collaboration , select Fabric Administrator . Click Save changes . API permissions ​ Who can do this? You need your Cloud Application Administrator or Application Administrator to complete these steps, you may not have access yourself. danger The following permissions are only required for delegated user authentication. If using service principal authentication, you don't need to configure any delegated permissions for a service principal—it's recommended that you avoid adding these permissions. These are never used and can cause errors that may be hard to troubleshoot. To add permissions for the registered application : In your app registration, click API permissions under the Manage section. Click Add a permission . Search for and select Power BI Service . Click Delegated permissions and select: Capacity.Read.All Dataflow.Read.All Dataset.Read.All Report.Read.All Tenant.Read.All Workspace.Read.All Click Grant Admin consent (If you only see the Add permissions button, you aren't an administrator). Admin API settings configuration ​ Who can do this? You need your Fabric Administrator ( formerly known as Power BI Administrator ) to complete these tasks, you may not have access yourself. To enable the Microsoft Power BI admin API: Log in to the Power BI admin portal . Click Tenant settings under Admin portal. Under Admin API settings : Expand Enhance admin APIs responses with detailed metadata and set to Enabled Add your security group Click Apply Expand Enhance admin APIs responses with DAX and mashup expressions and set to Enabled Add your security group Click Apply .

    "content": "Get Started What is Atlan? On this page What is Atlan? We are a modern data workspace that makes collaboration among diverse users like business, analysts, and engineers easier, increasing efficiency and agility in data projects. We started out as a data team, solving social good problems using data science. We built Atlan for ourselves over the course of 200 data projects, which included India's national data platform used by the prime minister and monitoring the Sustainable Development Goals with the United Nations. Atlan helped us build India's national data platform with an 8-member team, making it the fastest project of its kind to go live in just 12 months - instead of the projected three years. Why we built Atlan ​ Data teams can be diverse: analysts, scientists, engineers, and business users. Diverse people with diverse tools and skillsets mean diverse DNAs. All of it led to chaos, which made our Slack channels look like this... We call this \"collaboration overheard\" ​ We knew we couldn't scale like this, there had to be a better way. We borrowed the principles of Agile from product teams, DevOps from engineering teams, and Lean Manufacturing from supply chain teams. We then experimented for two years and across 200 data projects to create our own idea of what makes data teams successful. We call this DataOps . How Atlan helps data teams ​ With Atlan, analyst teams at Unilever have shipped 100+ additional data projects per quarter, while data science teams at Samsung have saved 50% of their time. Create self-service ecosystems by reducing dependencies ​ Atlan makes all your data assets easily discoverable. No more Slack messages like \"Where's that dataset?\" or long email threads for approvals. With Atlan, you can simply Cmd+K your way to the right data asset. Key capabilities : discovery and search , Visual Query Builder , saved queries , READMEs Improve the agility of your data team ​ Data practitioners spend 30-50% of their time finding and understanding data. Atlan cuts that time by 95%. Your data team will be shipping 2-3 times more projects in no time. Key capabilities : visibility of data quality tests and observability alerts, automated lineage , Atlan AI Promote governance and a sustainable data culture ​ Don't lose sleep trying to figure out if your sensitive data is secure. Build ecosystems of trust, make your team happy, and let Atlan manage governance and security behind the scenes.

    "content": "Get Started Quick Start Guides Administrators On this page Administrators User management ​ User management is a critical part of data governance. Atlan's user management capabilities should be a mainstay of how you organize and control access for people in your organization. Add and manage users from the admin center ​ It's super simple to invite and remove users from Atlan from the Admin center . You can also manage existing users by adding them to groups, changing their roles, or set up SSO , SCIM , and SMTP configurations. Manage access control from the governance center ​ The Governance center is where you can build access control mechanisms to manage user access . Personas allow you to group users into teams, such as Financial Analysts or Cloud Engineers , and set policies based on the access those personas should have. Purposes are where you can build policies based on the actions or access that a user might need. For example, you can use Atlan's policy-based access controls to manage access to PII and other sensitive data. This is a best practice for data governance. Once you set these policies, Atlan will enforce them throughout your users' experience. This means that users who don't have access to a particular type of data will not be able to see it. Governance workflows help you set up robust controls on data access management, metadata enrichment, new entity creation, and more, with out-of-the-box workflow templates and automated execution. Asset profile ​ The asset profile in Atlan gives you a quick and clear understanding of what a data asset contains. You can think of the asset profile as the TL;DR about your data. Glossary ​ The Atlan glossary is a rich tool for defining and organizing your data terminology to improve transparency and share knowledge. No need to ask around for what a column name means. The glossary functions as a source of truth for teams to understand their data assets. Start keeping all your definitions in one searchable place. The glossary provides key intel on your data assets so you can quickly understand important attributes of your data, such as: Owners of your data, so you know who to ask for clarification. Certificate status, to easily understand if metadata enrichment is still in progress or the asset is ready to be used. Linked assets that are relevant to the term, so you can explore other helpful material. Did you know? The glossary helps power Atlan's powerful search tool , so tagging and defining assets are critical to helping your team find what they need. Discovery ​ We rely on search bars to find things in almost every corner of the internet. Atlan uses a similar search tool to help you explore your data assets. The discovery tool is Atlan's powerful in-platform search, powered by the terms and descriptions you've added to your data assets. Here are a few of the things that make Atlan's discovery awesome: Every attribute of your data is searchable in Atlan - saved SQL queries, schemas, links, and more. This lets you search far and wide to find exactly what you need. Intelligent keyword recognition sees through your typos to show exactly what you wanted, no matter what you actually typed. Search assets from just about any page in Atlan using Cmd/Ctrl+K or by clicking Search assets across Atlan at the top of any page. Control your search by using facets about your data (such as the verification status or owner) to find what's most important to you. Sort by popularity to quickly discover what assets your teammates are using every day. Tags: get-started quick-start Previous What is Atlan?

    "title": "Set up Snowflake | Atlan Documentation",
    "content": "Connect data Data Warehouses Snowflake Get Started Set up Snowflake On this page Set up Snowflake Who can do this? You need your Snowflake administrator to run these commands - you may not have access yourself. Create user and role in Snowflake ​ Create a role and user in Snowflake using the following commands: Create role ​ Create a role in Snowflake using the following commands: CREATE OR REPLACE ROLE atlan_user_role ; GRANT OPERATE , USAGE ON WAREHOUSE \"<warehouse-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; Replace <warehouse-name> with the default warehouse to use when running the Snowflake crawler . Atlan requires the following privileges to: OPERATE enables Atlan to start the virtual warehouse to fetch metadata if the warehouse has stopped. USAGE enables Atlan to show or list metadata from Snowflake. This in turn enables the Snowflake crawler to run the SHOW query. Create a user ​ Create a separate user to integrate into Atlan, using one of the following 3 options: With a public key in Snowflake ​ See Snowflake's official guide for details on generating an RSA key-pair . To create a user with a key-pair, replace the value for rsa_public_key with the public key and run the following: CREATE USER atlan_user rsa_public_key = 'MIIBIjANBgkqh...' default_role = atlan_user_role default_warehouse = '<warehouse-name>' display_name = 'Atlan' TYPE = 'SERVICE' Learn more about the SERVICE type property in Snowflake documentation . Did you know? Atlan only supports encrypted private keys with a non-empty passphrase - generally recommended as more secure. An empty passphrase results in workflow failures. To generate an encrypted private key, omit the -nocrypt option. Refer to Snowflake documentation to learn more. With a password in Snowflake ​ Did you know? Snowflake recommends transitioning away from basic authentication using username and password. Change to key-pair authentication for enhanced security. For any existing Snowflake workflows, you can modify the crawler configuration to update the authentication method. To create a user with a password, replace <password> and run the following: CREATE USER atlan_user password = '<password>' default_role = atlan_user_role default_warehouse = '<warehouse-name>' display_name = 'Atlan' TYPE = 'LEGACY_SERVICE' Learn more about the LEGACY_SERVICE type property in Snowflake documentation . Managed through your identity provider (IdP) Private preview ​ This method is currently only available if Okta is your IdP (Snowflake supports) authenticating natively through Okta : Create a user in your identity provider (IdP) and use federated authentication in Snowflake . The password for this user must be maintained solely in the IdP and multi-factor authentication (MFA) must be disabled. Grant role to user ​ To grant the atlan_user_role to the new user: GRANT ROLE atlan_user_role TO USER atlan_user ; Configure OAuth (client credentials flow) with Microsoft Entra ID ​ To configure OAuth authentication using Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) with the client credentials flow: Follow Snowflake's documentation to: Register a new application in Microsoft Entra ID Collect the client ID , tenant ID , and client secret Add the required API permissions In Snowflake, create a security integration using the following: CREATE SECURITY INTEGRATION external_oauth_azure_ad TYPE = external_oauth ENABLED = true EXTERNAL_OAUTH_TYPE = azure EXTERNAL_OAUTH_ISSUER = '\\<AZURE_AD_ISSUER\\>' EXTERNAL_OAUTH_JWS_KEYS_URL = '\\<AZURE_AD_JWS_KEY_ENDPOINT\\>' EXTERNAL_OAUTH_AUDIENCE_LIST = ( '\\<SNOWFLAKE_APPLICATION_ID_URI\\>' ) EXTERNAL_OAUTH_TOKEN_USER_MAPPING_CLAIM = 'sub' EXTERNAL_OAUTH_SNOWFLAKE_USER_MAPPING_ATTRIBUTE = 'login_name' ; Replace the placeholders with actual values from your Azure AD app: <AZURE_AD_ISSUER> → Your tenant's OAuth 2.0 issuer URL <AZURE_AD_JWS_KEY_ENDPOINT> → Azure JWKs URI <SNOWFLAKE_APPLICATION_ID_URI> → Application ID URI of the Azure app Create a Snowflake user with a login name that exactly matches the Azure AD client object ID: CREATE USER oauth_svc_user WITH LOGIN_NAME = '\\<AZURE_AD_CLIENT_OBJECT_ID\\>' -- Use Azure client OBJECT ID DEFAULT_ROLE = \\ < ROLE\\ > DEFAULT_WAREHOUSE = \\ < WAREHOUSE\\ > ; Grant the configured role to this user: GRANT ROLE \\ < ROLE\\ > TO USER oauth_svc_user ; Choose metadata fetching method ​ Atlan supports two methods for fetching metadata from Snowflake - account usage and information schema. You should choose one of these two methods to set up Snowflake: Account usage Information schema Overview Simplified grants but some limitations in functionality Most comprehensive approach, more grant management required Method Views in the SNOWFLAKE database that display object metadata and usage metrics for your account System-defined views and table functions that provide extensive metadata for objects created in your account Permissions User role and account, single grant for SNOWFLAKE database User role and account, multiple grants per database Data latency 45 minutes to 3 hours (varies by view) None Historical data retention 1 year 7 days to 6 months (varies by view or table function) Asset extraction ACCOUNT_USAGE schema INFORMATION_SCHEMA schema View lineage ACCOUNT_USAGE schema INFORMATION_SCHEMA schema Table lineage ACCOUNT_USAGE schema ACCOUNT_USAGE schema Tag import ACCOUNT_USAGE schema ACCOUNT_USAGE schema Usage and popularity ACCOUNT_USAGE schema ACCOUNT_USAGE schema Metadata extraction time Varies by warehouse size. For example, 8 minutes for 10 million assets (recommended for extracting a large number of assets) Varies by warehouse size. For example, 2+ hours for 10 million assets Extraction limitations External table location data, procedures, and primary and foreign keys None Grant permissions for account usage method ​ danger If you want to set warehouse timeouts when using this method, set a large value initially for the workflow to succeed. Once the workflow has succeeded, adjust the value to be twice the extraction time. This method uses the views in SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE (or a copied version of this schema) to fetch the metadata from Snowflake into Atlan. You can be more granular with permissions using this method, but there are limitations with this approach . To crawl assets, generate lineage, and import tags ​ If you also want to be able to preview and query the data, you can use the preview and query existing assets permissions instead. Snowflake stores all tag objects in the ACCOUNT_USAGE schema. If you're using the account usage method to crawl metadata in Atlan or you have configured the Snowflake miner , you need to grant the same permissions to import tags as required for crawling Snowflake assets. Note that object tagging in Snowflake currently requires Enterprise Edition or higher . To use the default SNOWFLAKE database and ACCOUNT_USAGE schema and also mine Snowflake's query history (for lineage), grant these permissions: USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN ; GRANT IMPORTED PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE SNOWFLAKE TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; The ACCOUNTADMIN role is required to grant privileges on the SNOWFLAKE database due to the following reasons: By default, only the ACCOUNTADMIN role can access the SNOWFLAKE database. To enable other roles to access the database and schemas and query the views, a user with the ACCOUNTADMIN role needs to grant IMPORTED PRIVILEGES on the SNOWFLAKE database to the desired roles. To use a copied or cloned version of this default schema, where you can also remove any sensitive data for security purposes, grant these permissions: GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE \"<copied-database>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA \"<copied-schema>\" IN DATABASE \"<copied-database>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; GRANT REFERENCES ON ALL VIEWS IN DATABASE \"<copied-database>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; Replace <copied-database> with the copied Snowflake database name. Replace <copied-schema> with the copied Snowflake ACCOUNT_USAGE schema name. The grants for the copied version can't be used on the original SNOWFLAKE database. This is because Snowflake produces an error that granular grants can't be given to imported databases. When using a cloned or copied version, verify that the table or view definition remains unchanged as in your SNOWFLAKE database. If the format is different. For example, a column is missing and it no longer qualifies as a clone. To crawl streams ​ To crawl streams, provide the following permissions: To crawl current streams: GRANT USAGE ON ALL SCHEMAS IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; GRANT REFERENCES ON ALL TABLES IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; GRANT SELECT ON ALL STREAMS IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; Replace <database-name> with the Snowflake database name. To crawl future streams: GRANT USAGE ON FUTURE SCHEMAS IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; GRANT REFERENCES ON FUTURE TABLES IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; GRANT SELECT ON FUTURE STREAMS IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; Replace <database-name> with the Snowflake database name. (Optional) To preview and query existing assets ​ To query and preview data within assets that already exist in Snowflake, add these permissions: GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; GRANT USAGE ON ALL SCHEMAS IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; GRANT SELECT ON ALL EXTERNAL TABLES IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; GRANT SELECT ON ALL VIEWS IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; GRANT SELECT ON ALL MATERIALIZED VIEWS IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; GRANT SELECT ON ALL STREAMS IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; GRANT MONITOR ON PIPE \"<pipe-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; Replace <database-name> with the database you want to be able to preview and query in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database you wish to preview and query in Atlan.) (Optional) To preview and query future assets ​ To query and preview data within assets that may be created in the future in Snowflake, add these permissions. Again, if you want to also be able to preview and query the data for future assets, you can add the preview and query future assets permissions instead. GRANT USAGE ON FUTURE SCHEMAS IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; GRANT SELECT ON FUTURE TABLES IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; GRANT SELECT ON FUTURE EXTERNAL TABLES IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; GRANT SELECT ON FUTURE VIEWS IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; GRANT SELECT ON FUTURE MATERIALIZED VIEWS IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; GRANT SELECT ON FUTURE STREAMS IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; GRANT MONITOR ON FUTURE PIPES IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; Replace <database-name> with the database you want to be able to preview and query in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database you want to preview and query in Atlan.) danger Verify that all the assets you'd like to crawl are present in these grants by checking the grants on the user role defined for the crawler. Grant permissions for information schema method ​ This method uses views in the INFORMATION_SCHEMA schema in Snowflake databases to fetch metadata. You still need to grant specific permissions to enable Atlan to crawl metadata, preview data, and query data with this method. To crawl existing assets ​ Grant these permissions to crawl assets that already exist in Snowflake. If you also want to be able to preview and query the data, you can use the preview and query existing assets permissions instead. Grant permissions to crawl existing assets: GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; GRANT USAGE ON ALL SCHEMAS IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; GRANT REFERENCES ON ALL TABLES IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; GRANT REFERENCES ON ALL EXTERNAL TABLES IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; GRANT REFERENCES ON ALL VIEWS IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; GRANT REFERENCES ON ALL MATERIALIZED VIEWS IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; GRANT SELECT ON ALL STREAMS IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; GRANT MONITOR ON PIPE \"<pipe-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; Replace <database-name> with the database you want to be available in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database you wish to integrate into Atlan.) Grant permissions to crawl functions: GRANT USAGE ON ALL FUNCTIONS IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; Replace <database-name> with the database you want to be available in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database you wish to integrate into Atlan.) For secure user-defined functions (UDFs), grant OWNERSHIP permissions to retrieve metadata: GRANT OWNERSHIP ON FUNCTION < schema_name > . < udf_name > TO ROLE < role_name > ; Replace the placeholders with the appropriate values: <schema_name> : The name of the schema that contains the user-defined function (UDF). <udf_name> : The name of the secure UDF that requires ownership permissions. <role_name> : The role that gets assigned ownership of the secure UDF. Did you know? The statements given on this page apply to all schemas, tables, and views in a database in Snowflake. If you want to limit access to only certain objects, you can instead specify the exact objects individually as well. To crawl future assets ​ To crawl assets that may be created in the future in Snowflake, add these permissions. Again, if you want to also be able to preview and query the data for future assets, you can add the preview and query future assets permissions instead. To grant permissions at a database level: GRANT USAGE ON FUTURE SCHEMAS IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; GRANT REFERENCES ON FUTURE TABLES IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; GRANT REFERENCES ON FUTURE EXTERNAL TABLES IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; GRANT REFERENCES ON FUTURE VIEWS IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; GRANT REFERENCES ON FUTURE MATERIALIZED VIEWS IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; GRANT SELECT ON FUTURE STREAMS IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; GRANT MONITOR ON FUTURE PIPES IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; GRANT USAGE ON FUTURE FUNCTIONS IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; Replace <database-name> with the database you want to crawl in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database you want to integrate into Atlan.) danger For any future grants defined at a schema level to a different role, the schema-level grants take precedence over the database-level grants and any future grants defined at a database level to the Atlan role get ignored. To learn more, refer to Snowflake documentation . To grant permissions at a schema level: GRANT REFERENCES ON FUTURE TABLES IN SCHEMA \"<database-name>.<schema-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; GRANT REFERENCES ON FUTURE EXTERNAL TABLES IN SCHEMA \"<database-name>.<schema-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; GRANT REFERENCES ON FUTURE VIEWS IN SCHEMA \"<database-name>.<schema-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; GRANT REFERENCES ON FUTURE MATERIALIZED VIEWS IN SCHEMA \"<database-name>.<schema-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; GRANT SELECT ON FUTURE STREAMS IN SCHEMA \"<database-name>.<schema-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; GRANT MONITOR ON FUTURE PIPES IN SCHEMA \"<database-name>.<schema-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; Replace <database-name> with the database and <schema-name> with the schema you want to crawl in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database and schema you want to integrate into Atlan.) To mine query history for lineage ​ To also mine Snowflake's query history (for lineage), add these permissions. You can use either option: To mine query history direct from Snowflake's internal tables: USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN ; GRANT IMPORTED PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE snowflake TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; To mine query history from a cloned or copied set of tables, where you can also remove any sensitive data: GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE \"<cloned-database>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA \"<cloned-database>\" . \"<cloned-account-usage-schema>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA \"<cloned-database>\" . \"<cloned-account-usage-schema>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; GRANT SELECT ON ALL VIEWS IN SCHEMA \"<cloned-database>\" . \"<cloned-account-usage-schema>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; Replace <cloned-database> with the name of the cloned database, and <cloned-account-usage-schema> with the name of the cloned schema containing account usage details. When using a cloned or copied version, verify that the table or view definition remains unchanged as in your SNOWFLAKE database. If the format is different. For example, a column is missing and it no longer qualifies as a clone. (Optional) To preview and query existing assets ​ To query and preview data within assets that already exist in Snowflake, add these permissions: GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; GRANT USAGE ON ALL SCHEMAS IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; GRANT SELECT ON ALL EXTERNAL TABLES IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; GRANT SELECT ON ALL VIEWS IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; GRANT SELECT ON ALL MATERIALIZED VIEWS IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; GRANT SELECT ON ALL STREAMS IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; GRANT MONITOR ON PIPE \"<pipe-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; Replace <database-name> with the database you want to be able to preview and query in Atlan.

(Optional) To preview and query future assets ​ To query and preview data within assets that may be created in the future in Snowflake, add these permissions. Again, if you want to also be able to preview and query the data for future assets, you can add the preview and query future assets permissions instead. GRANT USAGE ON FUTURE SCHEMAS IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; GRANT SELECT ON FUTURE TABLES IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; GRANT SELECT ON FUTURE EXTERNAL TABLES IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; GRANT SELECT ON FUTURE VIEWS IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; GRANT SELECT ON FUTURE MATERIALIZED VIEWS IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; GRANT SELECT ON FUTURE STREAMS IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; GRANT MONITOR ON FUTURE PIPES IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; Replace <database-name> with the database you want to be able to preview and query in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database you want to preview and query in Atlan.) danger For any future grants defined at a schema level to a different role, the schema-level grants take precedence over the database-level grants and any future grants defined at a database level to the Atlan role get ignored. To learn more, refer to Snowflake documentation . To grant permissions at a schema level: GRANT SELECT ON FUTURE TABLES IN SCHEMA \"<database-name>.<schema-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; GRANT SELECT ON FUTURE EXTERNAL TABLES IN SCHEMA \"<database-name>.<schema-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; GRANT SELECT ON FUTURE VIEWS IN SCHEMA \"<database-name>.<schema-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; GRANT SELECT ON FUTURE MATERIALIZED VIEWS IN SCHEMA \"<database-name>.<schema-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; GRANT SELECT ON FUTURE STREAMS IN SCHEMA \"<database-name>.<schema-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; GRANT MONITOR ON FUTURE PIPES IN SCHEMA \"<database-name>.<schema-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; Replace <database-name> with the database and <schema-name> with the schema you want to be able to preview and query in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database and schema you want to preview and query in Atlan.) danger Verify that all the assets you'd like to crawl are present in these grants by checking the grants on the user role defined for the crawler. (Optional) To import Snowflake tags ​ Snowflake stores all tag objects in the ACCOUNT_USAGE schema. Note that object tagging in Snowflake currently requires Enterprise Edition or higher . To import tags from Snowflake , grant these permissions: To use the default SNOWFLAKE database and ACCOUNT_USAGE schema and also mine Snowflake's query history (for lineage), grant these permissions: USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN ; GRANT IMPORTED PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE SNOWFLAKE TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; The ACCOUNTADMIN role is required to grant privileges on the SNOWFLAKE database due to the following reasons: By default, only the ACCOUNTADMIN role can access the SNOWFLAKE database. To enable other roles to access the database and schemas and query the views, a user with the ACCOUNTADMIN role needs to grant IMPORTED PRIVILEGES on the SNOWFLAKE database to the desired roles. To use a copied or cloned version of this default schema, where you can also remove any sensitive data for security purposes, grant these permissions: GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE \"<copied-database>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA \"<copied-schema>\" IN DATABASE \"<copied-database>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; GRANT REFERENCES ON ALL VIEWS IN DATABASE \"<copied-database>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; Replace <copied-database> with the copied Snowflake database name. Replace <copied-schema> with the copied Snowflake ACCOUNT_USAGE schema name. The grants for the copied version can't be used on the original SNOWFLAKE database. This is because Snowflake produces an error that granular grants can't be given to imported databases. (Optional) To push updated tags to Snowflake ​ To push tags updated for assets in Atlan to Snowflake , grant these permissions: GRANT APPLY TAG ON ACCOUNT TO ROLE < role - name > ; You can learn more about tag privileges from Snowflake documentation . (Optional) To crawl dynamic tables ​ Atlan currently supports fetching metadata for dynamic tables using the MONITOR privilege. Refer to Snowflake documentation to learn more. To crawl existing dynamic tables from Snowflake: Grant permissions at a database level: GRANT MONITOR ON ALL DYNAMIC TABLES IN DATABASE \"<DATABASE_NAME>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; Grant permissions at a schema level: GRANT MONITOR ON ALL DYNAMIC TABLES IN SCHEMA \"<database-name>.<schema-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; To crawl future dynamic tables from Snowflake: Grant permissions at a database level: GRANT MONITOR ON FUTURE DYNAMIC TABLES IN DATABASE \"<DATABASE_NAME>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; Grant permissions at a schema level: GRANT MONITOR ON FUTURE DYNAMIC TABLES IN SCHEMA \"<database-name>.<schema-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; Replace <database-name> with the database and <schema-name> with the schema you want to crawl in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database and schema you want to integrate into Atlan.) (Optional) To crawl Iceberg tables ​ Atlan currently supports fetching metadata for Iceberg tables only for the information schema extraction method. To crawl Iceberg tables from Snowflake, grant the following permissions: To crawl existing Iceberg tables in Snowflake: GRANT REFERENCES ON ALL ICEBERG TABLES IN DATABASE < database - name > TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; To crawl future Iceberg tables in Snowflake: GRANT REFERENCES ON FUTURE ICEBERG TABLES IN DATABASE < database - name > TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; To crawl Iceberg catalog metadata for Iceberg tables in Snowflake: GRANT USAGE ON INTEGRATION < integration - name > TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; danger You must first grant permissions to crawl existing Iceberg tables for this permission to work on catalogs. You must also grant permissions to all the catalogs you want to crawl in Atlan individually. (Optional) To crawl Snowflake stages ​ Atlan supports crawling metadata for Snowflake stages using the USAGE and READ privileges. For more information, see the Snowflake documentation for INFORMATION_SCHEMA.STAGES. To crawl stages from Snowflake: Grant USAGE and READ privileges on all existing stages at the database level: GRANT USAGE ON ALL STAGES IN DATABASE < database_name > TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; GRANT READ ON ALL STAGES IN DATABASE < database_name > TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; Replace <database_name> with the name of your Snowflake database Replace <atlan_user_role> with the role you've granted Atlan to use for crawling.

Automated operations ​ Continuously monitors system health and sends heartbeats to Atlan. Captures and uploads execution logs for troubleshooting and auditing. Provides performance insights through metrics and alerts. How it works ​ The Secure Agent follows a job-based execution model where metadata extraction tasks are scheduled and executed within the organization's environment. The workflow typically involves: Atlan triggers a metadata extraction job. The Secure Agent retrieves job details and extracts metadata using source-specific connectors. Extracted metadata is shared with Atlan either through cloud storage or direct ingestion. Atlan workflows process the extracted metadata and publish the assets. Logs and execution status are sent to Atlan for monitoring and auditing.

What is the difference between a Power BI data source and dataflow? In Microsoft Power BI: Data source - a data source is any source that fuels a dataset. You can connect to different types of data sources, such as databases, files, Microsoft Fabric, and more, to fetch data directly into Microsoft Power BI for creating reports and dashboards. For a full list, refer to Microsoft Power BI documentation . Dataflows - data flows help you encode the process of extracting and transforming data from a data source to produce a dataset. These have a refresh frequency that keeps the dataset in sync with the data source. To learn more, refer to Microsoft Power BI documentation .

The following limitations apply as mentioned below: PowerBI Pages (which are a part of PowerBI Report) won't be catalogued. Downstream Lineage from PowerBI Table Column / Measure -> PowerBI Page won't be available. Can users who don't have access to a report still see the preview? ​ Users can only see asset previews if the following conditions are met: They have the necessary permissions in both Microsoft Power BI and Atlan. They're logged into Atlan and Microsoft Power BI on the same browser. Therefore, if a user lacks the permission to view a report in Microsoft Power BI, they won't be able to see the report preview in Atlan. Even if they do have the necessary permissions, they need to be logged into Microsoft Power BI on the same browser as their Atlan instance for asset previews to work. Why can I not see previews for my Microsoft Power BI assets? ​ Your Microsoft Power BI assets are updated with previews during the next run of your Microsoft Power BI workflow. If you have run the workflow and still don't see the previews, rerun the workflow. Once you've rerun the workflow, the previews are visible to all eligible users. How does Atlan calculate views for Microsoft Power BI reports and dashboards? ​ Atlan calculates Usage views based on the number of times users open a report or dashboard in Microsoft Power BI.

To crawl metadata from Microsoft Power BI, review the order of operations and then complete the following steps. Select the source ​ To select Microsoft Power BI as your source: In the top right of any screen, navigate to New and then click New Workflow . From the list of packages, select Power BI Assets and click on Setup Workflow . Provide credentials ​ To enter your Microsoft Power BI credentials: For Authentication, choose the method you want to use to access Microsoft Power BI: For Service Principal authentication, enter the Tenant Id , Client Id , and Client Secret you configured when setting up Microsoft Power BI . Use the Enable Only Admin API Access option to control how metadata is extracted. When enabled, the crawler uses only admin APIs. If disabled, both admin and non-admin APIs are used. For Delegated User authentication, enter the Username , Password , Tenant Id , Client Id , and Client Secret you configured when setting up Microsoft Power BI . At the bottom of the form, click the Test Authentication button to confirm connectivity to Microsoft Power BI using these details. Once successful, at the bottom of the screen click the Next button. Configure connection ​ To complete the Microsoft Power BI connection configuration: Provide a Connection Name that represents your source environment. For example, you might want to use values like production , development , gold , or analytics . (Optional) To change the users able to manage this connection, change the users or groups listed under Connection Admins . danger If you don't specify any user or group, nobody can manage the connection - not even admins. At the bottom of the screen, click the Next button to proceed. Configure the crawler ​ Before running the Microsoft Power BI crawler, configure metadata extraction and advanced options. You can override the default settings for the following fields. Configure metadata ​ Include Workspaces : Select Microsoft Power BI workspaces to include. Defaults to all workspaces when left blank. Use Advanced Search to filter workspaces using the following options: Contains : Matches workspaces that contain the given substring. Starts with : Matches workspaces that begin with the specified text. Ends with : Matches workspaces that end with the specified text. Regex pattern : Matches workspaces based on a regular expression. All selected filters apply using an AND condition. Exclude Workspaces : Select workspaces to exclude. No workspaces are excluded by default. Advanced Search is also available for exclusion, with the same filtering options as mentioned previously. Include Dashboard and Reports Regex : Use a regular expression to include dashboards and reports based on naming patterns. Includes all by default. Exclude Dashboard and Reports Regex : Use a regular expression to exclude dashboards and reports based on naming patterns. Excludes none by default. Attach Endorsements from Power BI : Automatically certify assets endorsed in Power BI. To manually review before applying, change this setting to Send a Request . For more details, see What does Atlan crawl from Microsoft Power BI? Configure advanced settings ​ Source Connections : When your tenant has multiple connections available for the same source system that share the similar metadata, confirm the advanced options and choose the correct connections from the Source Connections list drop down to avoid creating duplicate lineage to such connections. Enable ODBC DSN Connectivity Mapping : Power BI provides multiple ways of connecting to a SQL source, including ODBC connectivity for building Reports and Dashboards. When datasets are populated using ODBC, provide a mapping of the DSN ( Data Source Name ) names to their appropriate database qualified names after enabling this toggle. Did you know? If a workspace appears in both the include and exclude filters, the exclude filter takes precedence. Run the crawler ​ To run the Microsoft Power BI crawler: To check for any permissions or other configuration issues before running the crawler, click Preflight checks . You can either: To run the crawler once immediately, at the bottom of the screen, click the Run button. To schedule the crawler to run hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly, at the bottom of the screen, click the Schedule Run button. Once the crawler has completed running, you can see the assets in Atlan's asset page! 🎉 Tags: connectors data crawl Previous Set up Microsoft Power BI Next Mine Microsoft Power BI Select the source Provide credentials Configure connection Configure the crawler Run the crawler",

    "content": "Configure Atlan Playbooks Troubleshooting Troubleshooting playbooks On this page Troubleshooting playbooks warning 🤓 Who can do this? You will need to be an admin user in Atlan to create playbooks. Here are a few things to know about setting up playbooks : What are the known limitations of the domain action? ​ Following are the known issues or limitations when using the domain action : Atlan currently does not support adding glossaries, categories, and terms to domains. If you do not have read permission on the assets you want to add to a domain, those assets will be removed from the playbook workflow during processing. If you do not have update permission on the assets you want to add to a domain, the playbook workflow will fail. However, some assets may still be linked to the domain before the failure occurs. What type of infrastructure costs can I expect to incur? ​ Atlan uses Elasticsearch to run playbooks, so expect infrastructure costs to be minimal and not a determining factor for utilizing playbooks. What is the maximum number of playbooks that can be run? ​ We recommend building no more than a maximum of 20 rules per playbook. However, the total number of playbooks that can be run is still to be determined. From a technical standpoint, playbooks leverage the workflow infrastructure, which means there are no hard limits. Depending on the number of playbooks that need to be run, the infrastructure will have to be scaled accordingly. Do I also need to have update permissions for playbooks? ​ Yes. You need to have the permission to update assets in Atlan in order to run playbooks for updating them. If you do not have the permission to update an asset, you will be unable to update it using playbooks. Additionally, Atlan uses the permissions of the playbook creator in determining the assets to be updated and not that of the user who runs the playbook. Your user permissions are used to determine the bulk updates you can make to ensure that there is no adverse impact on assets beyond your scope of access. Can I automate requests for updates through playbooks? ​ No, Atlan currently does not support automating asset update requests through playbooks. Is there a way to undo updates made through playbooks? ​ Currently, there is no button to undo asset updates. However, you can modify your existing playbooks . You can either turn off the filters or add new rules to reverse the updates. Is there a way to view or download a report of updated assets from previous playbook runs? ​ Currently, no. You can monitor your existing playbooks to view a high-level summary of asset updates from previous playbook runs. Observability of results is on the roadmap. Can I get email notifications for playbook run successes or failures? ​ Currently, no. However, you can set up Slack or Microsoft Teams alerts for your playbook runs in Atlan. How to handle an offload node status is not supported error? ​ If you encounter an offload node status is not supported error message, the playbook workflow may have exceeded the EtcD size limit. Playbooks use Argo workflow templates, which are stored as Kubernetes resources. This creates a limit to their size. To handle this error, Atlan recommends the following: Reduce the number of rules in your playbook Optimize filters for asset selection Tags: atlan documentation Previous Automate data profiling",

    "content": "Configure Atlan Playbooks Get Started Set up playbooks On this page Set up playbooks warning 🤓 Who can do this? You will need to be an admin user in Atlan to create playbooks. A common question that data teams often face is how to automate metadata at scale. Having started out as a data team ourselves, we know that automating repetitive tasks can help data teams maximize the value they provide to their organization. One way of doing so is through Atlan's playbooks! Playbooks help power metadata automation for your data assets in Atlan. You can create rule-based automations at scale and update metadata in bulk, helping you streamline your workflows. You can update the following asset metadata using playbooks: Certificates Descriptions Owners Terms Tags Domains Custom metadata For example, imagine your organization needs to transfer ownership of several data assets. Instead of your data team manually updating the ownership of each and every asset, you can create a playbook to automate this process and update the metadata of your assets at scale. Playbook recommendations ​ Before you begin, review some general guidelines on running playbooks in Atlan: Avoid running multiple playbooks simultaneously on the same set of assets. Allow one playbook run to be completed before proceeding with another operation on the same set of assets. Otherwise, you may experience performance issues and inconsistencies. Review and understand the depth of your asset lineage or hierarchy prior to enabling a tag propagation playbook. For assets with complex lineage, tag propagation may take longer to complete than the playbook runtime. You may want to review and judiciously select a list of assets that need to be tagged directly. For their child and/or downstream assets, Atlan recommends that you enable tag propagation . Create a playbook ​ To create a playbook in Atlan: From the left  in Atlan, you can either: Click Assets to navigate to the assets page. From the Filters  on the left or the tabs along the top, apply any asset filters . Next to the search bar, click the 3-dot icon and then click Create playbook to create a playbook for the filtered assets - this option is only visible to admin users. Click Governance to navigate to the governance center. Under the Governance heading of the Governance center , click Playbooks . Click Create New to get started. In the Create new playbook dialog box, enter the following details: For Name , enter a name for the task to be accomplished - for example, Update ownership . (Atlan recommends that the length of a playbook name must be no longer than 46 characters.) (Optional) For Description , enter a description. (Optional) Select an icon for your playbook. Click Create to save your playbook. Set up rules as filters ​ To set up rules as filters for your playbook: In the Build Rules page of your playbook, click Filters . For name, add a name to your filter. To set a matching condition for the filters, select Match all or Match any . Match all will logically AND the criteria, while Match any will logically OR the criteria. For Attributes , select a relevant option: For this example, we'll click Connection and then select a Snowflake connection. (Optional) To further refine your asset selection: Click All databases to filter by databases in a selected connection. Click All schemas to filter by schemas in a selected connection. Click Connector to filter assets by supported connectors . Click Asset type to filter by specific asset types - for example, tables, columns, queries, glossaries, and more. Click Certificate to filter assets by certification status . Click Owners to filter assets by asset owners . Click Tags to filter assets by your tags in Atlan, including imported Snowflake and dbt tags. (Optional) For Snowflake tags only, to the left of the checkbox, click Select value , and then from the Select tag value dialog, select any value(s) to filter assets by tag value. Click Glossary, terms, & categories to filter by a specific glossary or category to bulk update all the nested terms or by multiple glossaries and categories. Click Linked terms to filter assets by linked terms . Click Domains to filter by specific domains or subdomains to bulk update all the assets included in those data domains or subdomains. Click Products to filter for data products by specific data domains or subdomains. Click Schema qualified Name to filter assets by the qualified name of a given schema. Click Database qualified Name to filter assets by the qualified name of a given database. Click dbt to filter assets by dbt-specific filters and then select a dbt Cloud or dbt Core filter.

Click Soda to filter assets by Soda-specific filters . Click Table/View to filter tables or views by row count, column count, or size. Click Column to filter columns by column-specific filters , including parent asset type or name, data type, or column keys . Click Process to filter lineage processes by the SQL query. Click Query to filter assets by associated visual queries . Click Measure to filter Microsoft Power BI measures using the external measures filter. For Operator , select Is one of for values to include or Is not for values to exclude. Depending on the selected attribute(s), you can also choose from additional operators : Select Equals (=) or Not Equals (!=) to include or exclude assets through exact match search. Select Starts With or Ends With to filter assets using the starting or ending sequence of values. Select Contains or Does not contain to find assets with or without specified values contained within the attribute. Select Pattern to filter assets using supported Elastic DSL regular expressions . Select Is empty to filter assets with null values. Select Belongs to or Doesn't belong to to filter data products by specific data domains or subdomains . For Values , select the relevant values. The values will vary depending on the selected attributes. (Optional) To add more filters, click Add filter and select Filter to add individual filters or Filter Group to nest more filters in a group. (Optional) To view all the assets that match your rules, in the Filters card, click View all for a preview. (Optional) To remove a playbook filter, to the right of any filter, click the three horizontal dots and then click Delete . (Optional) To turn off a playbook filter, to the right of any filter, click the three horizontal dots and then click Disable . Click Enable to turn on any disabled filters. Select the actions ​ To select the actions to be performed based on your rules: In the Build Rules page of your playbook, click Actions . For Select Action , select the relevant metadata option to update: Click Certificate to update the certification status of assets to Verified , Draft , Deprecated , or No certificate . Click Description to update the description of your assets. Click Owners to add, remove, or replace asset owners . In this example, we'll update the ownership of the assets. Click Terms to add terms to your assets or remove or replace them from linked assets . Click Tags to add tags to your assets or remove or replace them from tagged or propagated assets. Note that if there are multiple tag actions to be performed, Atlan will execute them in the following order: ADD , REMOVE , and then REPLACE . Click Domain to add your assets to a specific domain or subdomain or remove them from an existing linked domain or subdomain . Click any custom metadata structure and then select a custom metadata property to update or unlink it from your assets. For Select operator , select the relevant option. The operators will vary depending on the selected action. For Values , select the relevant option(s). The values will vary depending on the selected actions. (Optional) To add more actions, click Add Action . Did you know? You can control tag propagation when adding tags as an action in playbooks. Tag propagation is disabled by default. If you enable tag propagation, you will also be able to configure how tags are propagated . Run the playbook ​ If you'd like to continue working on your playbook, you can save it as a draft. If your playbook is ready, you can proceed to running it. To run the playbook: You can either: To run the playbook once immediately, click Run once . To schedule the playbook to run hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly, click Schedule and choose the preferred frequency, timezone, and time. danger If you're scheduling multiple playbooks, Atlan recommends spacing out the schedules as much as possible to minimize any overlap between the playbook workflow runs.

    "content": "Build governance Contracts Impact Analysis Add contract impact analysis in GitHub On this page Add contract impact analysis in GitHub Private Preview Impact analysis helps you identify how modifications to your data contracts might impact downstream processes, data quality, and overall business operations. This can help you analyze proposed changes and mitigate potential risks before implementation. If you have ever changed a data contract only to find out later that it broke a downstream table or dashboard, Atlan provides a GitHub Action to help you out. This action places Atlan's impact analysis right into your pull request. So, you can view the potential downstream impact of your changes before merging the pull request. Prerequisites ​ Before running the action, you will need to create an Atlan API token . You will also need to assign a persona to the API token and add a metadata policy that provides the requisite permissions on assets for the Atlan action to work. For example, you can add the following permissions: Asset, such as a table - Read only Any downstream connections, such as Microsoft Power BI - Read only You will need to configure the default GITHUB_TOKEN permissions. Grant Read and write permissions to the GITHUB_TOKEN in your repository to allow the atlan-action to seamlessly add or update comments on pull requests. Refer to GitHub documentation to learn more. Configure the action ​ To set up the Atlan action in GitHub: Create repository secrets in your repository: ATLAN_INSTANCE_URL with the URL of your Atlan instance. ATLAN_API_TOKEN with the value of the API token. Add the GitHub Action to your workflow: Create a workflow file in your repository - .github/workflows/atlan-action.yml . Add the following code to your workflow file: name : Atlan action on : pull_request : types : [ opened , edited , synchronize , reopened , closed ] jobs : get-downstream-impact : name : Get Downstream Assets runs-on : ubuntu - latest steps : - name : Checkout uses : actions/checkout@v4 - name : Run Action uses : atlanhq/atlan - action@v1 with : GITHUB_TOKEN : $ { { secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN } } ATLAN_INSTANCE_URL : $ { { secrets.ATLAN_INSTANCE_URL } } ATLAN_API_TOKEN : $ { { secrets.ATLAN_API_TOKEN } } ATLAN_CONFIG : .atlan/config.yaml Test the action ​ After you've completed the configuration above, create a pull request with a changed Atlan data contract file to test the action. You should see the Atlan GitHub action running and then adding comments in your pull request: The GitHub workflow will add and update a single comment for every file change. The impacted assets in the comment will be displayed in a collapsible section and grouped by source and asset type. The comment will include some metadata for your impacted assets - such as descriptions, owners, and linked glossary terms. View impacted assets directly in Atlan. Inputs ​ Name Description Required GITHUB_TOKEN For writing comments on PRs to print downstream assets true ATLAN_INSTANCE_URL For making API requests to the user's tenant true ATLAN_API_TOKEN For authenticating API requests to the user's tenant true ATLAN_CONFIG For impact analysis of Atlan data contracts , if included in a GitHub PR true Tags: data api Previous Create data contracts Prerequisites Configure the action Test the action Inputs",

    "title": "Create data contracts | Atlan Documentation",
    "content": "Build governance Contracts Get Started Create data contracts On this page Create data contracts Private Preview A data contract is an agreement between a data producer and consumer that specifies requirements for generating and using high-quality, reliable data. As a powerful tool for data management, data contracts can help you standardize contractual obligations between data producers and consumers, organize your assets with embeddable contract metadata, and enforce them with data quality rules. In Atlan, you can directly add a data contract to supported assets and provide helpful context to your downstream users. For a data contract to help build trust in your assets, it should be: Templatized and easily comprehensible - use Atlan's YAML contract template to create standardized contracts and push to Atlan. Version-controlled - continuously validate and monitor your data contracts either in runtime or real-time. Embeddable - embed the contract as metadata for a supported asset. Enforceable - enforce your contracts with data quality rules. Extensible - identify new specifications, generate new versions, and then compare and contrast them. Did you know? You can create webhooks for data contracts and receive notifications for when a contract is added or updated to a URL of your choice. Supported asset types ​ You can create data contracts for the following asset types: Tables Views Materialized views Output port assets of data products Supported asset metadata ​ Atlan maps the following asset metadata properties to it contract properties: Metadata property Contract property name dataset typeName type userDescription or description description ownerUsers owner.users ownerGroups owners.groups certificateStatus certification.status certificateStatusMessage certification.message announcementType announcement.type announcementTitle announcement.title announcementMessage announcement.description meaningNames terms classificationDef.displayName tags.name classifications.propagate tags.propagate classifications.restrict_propagation_through_lineage tags.restrict_propagation_through_lineage classifications.restrict_propagation_through_hierarchy tags.restrict_propagation_through_hierarchy column.name columns.name column.userDescription or column.description columns.description column.dataType columns.data_type column.isPrimary columns.primary !column.isNullable columns.required column.precision columns.precision column.numericScale columns.scale tags on column columns.tags column.meaningNames columns.terms custom metadata (CM) custom_metadata.<CM> Add a data contract to an asset ​ Who can do this? Any non-guest user with edit access to an asset's metadata can create, deploy, and manage data contracts. This only includes admin and member users in Atlan. To add a data contract to an asset, you can either: Create a contract directly in Atlan from the Contracts tab of the asset profile.

    "content": "Use data Lineage Concepts What is lineage? On this page Lineage Data lineage captures how data moves across your data landscape. This information is useful to: Trace data's origins, to assist with root cause analysis Trace data's destinations, to assist with impact analysis Automate the propagation of metadata to derived assets Did you know? Tag propagation is disabled by default in Atlan. You can enable tag propagation to child and downstream assets. Root cause analysis ​ Root cause analysis is about identifying the underlying causes of a data problem. You want to know where the data came from and what happened to it before it got to you. With root cause analysis, your focus is on these upstream sources and transformations. Impact analysis ​ Impact analysis is about identifying potential consequences of changes. You want to know where the data is going and what could happen to others if you change it. With impact analysis, the primary focus is on these downstream systems and consumers. Did you know? When viewing lineage in Atlan, hover over any asset to view a metadata popover. The metadata popovers display relevant metadata for the asset, providing you with more context for your analysis. For example, database and schema names for Snowflake assets, project names for dbt models, and more. How does it work? ​ Atlan constructs lineage by combining assets and processes: Assets represent the inputs and outputs of processes - databases, dashboards, and so on. Processes represent the activities that move or transform data between the assets. (Processes are the lines between the assets in Atlan's graphical view.) Atlan chains these together into a flow of data from various resources: SQL parsing ​ Atlan parses SQL queries to determine how data stores have created or transformed assets. Examples of this include: Amazon Redshift dbt Generic query logs (via S3 objects) Google BigQuery Snowflake API crawling ​ Atlan also retrieves lineage information for assets from APIs. Examples of this include: Databricks (Unity Catalog) Looker Microsoft Power BI Tableau API ingestion ​ Atlan provides built-in lineage extraction for the tools above. But you can also extend lineage with your own information using Atlan's open APIs . You can use these to integrate lineage from your own -grown tools or orchestration suites like Apache Airflow and Dagster .

You will probably need your Monte Carlo account owner to complete these steps - you may not have access yourself. Atlan supports the API authentication method for fetching metadata from Monte Carlo. This method uses an API key ID and secret to fetch metadata. Create an account-service API key ​ Did you know? Atlan does not make any API requests or queries that will update the objects in your Monte Carlo environment. You will need to create an account-service API key in Monte Carlo for integration with Atlan. To create an account-service API key for crawling Monte Carlo : Log in to your Monte Carlo instance. In the top  of your Monte Carlo instance, click Settings . In the left  under Settings , click API Access and then click Account Service Keys . From the Account Service Keys page, click the Create Key button. In the Create Account Service Key dialog, enter the following details: For Description , add a meaningful description for your API key - for example, Atlan connection . From the Authorization Groups dropdown, select Viewers (All) to provide minimum permissions for crawling Monte Carlo. (Optional) For Expires After , keep the default selection or select a preferred option. Click Create to finish creating the account-service API key. From the corresponding screen, copy the Key ID and Secret and store them in a secure location. danger The API secret cannot be retrieved later.

    "title": "Cloud logging and monitoring | Atlan Documentation",
    "content": "Get Started Administration Cloud logging and monitoring On this page Cloud logging and monitoring Atlan exports IAM service event logs in the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) specification and securely delivers them to the Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket of your organization. This enables you to monitor login events and integrate logs with security information and event management (SIEM) systems for real-time security monitoring and alerts. Key aspects ​ Log format and structure: The OTLP format ensures seamless integration with SIEM systems, and logs are organized by date and event type. Logs are stored in a compressed format in your organization's preferred object storage (S3 or GCS). Once uncompressed, the logs will be available in a JSON file format containing multiple log entries. Each file is saved for an hour in the following folder structure in gzip: /year=YYYY/month=MM/day=DD/hour=HH/logs_<rnd-9-digit-int>.json.gz The JSON file structure is as follows: { \"resourceLogs\" : [ { \"resource\" : { \"attributes\" : [ // k8s metadata ] } , \"scopeLogs\" : [ { \"scope\" : { } , \"logRecords\" : [ { \"timeUnixNano\" : \"1725861538220747913\" , \"observedTimeUnixNano\" : \"1726071786185095727\" , \"body\" : { \"stringValue\" : \"//redacted logline\" } , \"traceId\" : \"\" , \"spanId\" : \"\" } ] } , { ... } , ] } , { \"resource\" : { ... } , \"scopeLogs\" : [ ... ] } ] } Secure delivery- Logs are encrypted in transit and at rest, with mechanisms to validate data integrity. Customer access: Logs are easily accessible through S3 or GCS, allowing for a flexible monitoring and alerting setup. Enabling event logs in AWS ​ Prerequisites ​ Enable bucket versioning. Both source and destination buckets must have versioning enabled. See AWS documentation . Customer-provided bucket details: account ID, bucket name, and region. Atlan will use these details to create an IAM role on the Atlan side and then provide you with the bucket policy to be attached. Once you have confirmed that the bucket policy has been attached, Atlan will complete the final step of setting up log replication. Atlan support will complete the configuration on the Atlan side. You will need to attach the following policy to your destination bucket: { \"Version\" : \"2012-10-17\" , \"Id\" : \"\" , \"Statement\" : [ { \"Sid\" : \"Set-permissions-for-objects\" , \"Effect\" : \"Allow\" , \"Principal\" : { \"AWS\" : \"<Atlan Role ARN>\" } , \"Action\" : [ \"s3:ReplicateObject\" , \"s3:ReplicateDelete\" , \"s3:GetBucketVersioning\" , \"s3:PutBucketVersioning\" ] , \"Resource\" : [ \"arn:aws:s3:::<Customer S3 Bucket Name>/*\" , \"arn:aws:s3:::<Customer S3 Bucket Name>\" ] } ] } Continuous replication to S3 bucket ​ Application audit logs are streamed to Atlan's S3 bucket in near real time — within 10 seconds of being generated. This is a continuous process. Once the logs are available in Atlan's bucket, the logs will be replicated to your organization's S3 bucket within 15 minutes. The replication is ongoing and occurs without delays. This ensures that logs are continuously transferred as they are generated, with no waiting period between replications. Enabling event logs in GCP ​ For Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Atlan utilizes Logs Router to transfer logs from the GCS bucket of your Atlan tenant to a destination bucket of your choice. The destination must be supported by the Logs Router. The organization must provide details of the destination where the logs should be synced. This destination must be supported by the Logs Router. Atlan will create a Log Router sink and provide you with a service account. Depending on the selected destination, you will need to configure the necessary permissions for the service account as outlined in Google documentation . Once you have configured the permissions, the logs will begin syncing to your preferred destination. New sinks to Cloud Storage buckets may take several hours to start routing log entries. Sinks to Cloud Storage are processed hourly while other destination types are processed in real time.

    "content": "Use data Discovery Get Started Search and discover assets On this page Search and discover assets Atlan is a living catalog of all your data assets and knowledge. It lets you quickly discover and access your data, along with the tribal knowledge and business context. Its Amazon-like search and filtering experience isn't just for data tables. It also extends to a variety of data assets, like columns, databases, SQL queries, BI dashboards, and much more. To ensure a high-quality search experience, Atlan recommends the following: Certify your assets Link terms to your assets to add business context Enrich your assets with descriptions Star your assets for easy access Did you know? You can bookmark your search results with applied filters or share them with other Atlan users in your organization for quick and easy access. Search superpowers ​ Let's find out what makes Atlan's search intuitive and super quick. Intelligent keyword recognition Atlan supports powerful, intelligent search. When you search using keywords, the keywords in the matching search results will be highlighted for easy recognition. Even if your keyword contains an underscore _ or a period . - for example, instacart_order - both keywords will be highlighted across all search results. For keyword-based search: If the keywords you're searching by is present in the asset name, description , or linked term , only then will the asset appear in your search results. Atlan displays search results based on asset names - technical name and alias - that match your keyword(s). If the keyword is a glossary term linked to assets or present in asset descriptions , such assets will be boosted in search results. Whether your search query is incomplete ( insta ) or misspelled ( instacrt ordr ), Atlan's powerful search can still help you discover exactly what you need. Search from anywhere ​ There are multiple ways to start your search: Click the Search assets across Atlan bar on the page. Click Assets in the left-side panel. Use Cmd/Ctrl + K to open the search page from anywhere in Atlan. Search using context ​ The Assets section offers a variety of filters to narrow down your search. Here are the different types of filters that you can use: Source : Search by connectors , chosen from a list of connections within Atlan. Domains : Filter assets by domains , such as a single domain, multiple domains, or no domain. Certificate : Search based on the certificate attached to data assets, such as Verified , Draft , Deprecated , and No certificate . Owners : Filter by selecting one or more users. You can also toggle between users and groups to filter based on a group of users. Tags : Filter by user-generated tags, such as public , PII , and more. Terms : Filter by terms from your glossaries, such as cost , revenue , or P&L . Properties : Filter assets by other properties, like technical name or alias , description , last updated, and so on. Atlan's search results include a quick count of all the resulting data assets grouped by type. As you apply the filters, you'll see these counts change in real time. You can also enter a keyword in the search bar and filter your results by a specific type of data asset. For instance, enter the keyword order in the search bar and then click the Column checkbox to view column results for your searched keyword. Sort search results ​ Atlan allows you to sort your search results in different ways. This helps you quickly find the assets you're interested in. Sorting options include: Relevance : Sort by how closely the search results match your searched keywords. Name : Sort by the asset name in an alphabetical or a reverse alphabetical order. Updated on Atlan : Sort by the newest or oldest updated assets. Star count : Sort assets by most or fewest stars . Order : Sort the search results in an ascending or descending order. Popularity : Sort Snowflake and Google BigQuery assets by the most or least popular assets . Did you know? The sorting options may vary depending on the asset type selected. For example, if you are viewing the results while filtering by the Table tab, you'll also have the option of sorting by the most or fewest number of rows and columns. Search with patterns ​ You can refine your search in Atlan with the following patterns: Exact match search : Wrap the keywords within single '' or double \"\" quotation marks when typing them in the search bar - for example, \"instacart_total_users\" . Only the asset names with case-insensitive exact match and following the order of the keywords will be boosted in the search results - for example, instacart_total_users or Instacart_Total_Users . If the keywords are contained in the asset description or linked terms , such assets will show up next. Additionally, you can use exact match to search by the qualifiedName or globally unique identifier (GUID) of an asset. Combined string of database, schema, and table : For a more data-friendly search experience, copy the combined string of database.schema.table (or schema.table ) from your SQL editor and paste it in the search bar - for example, atlan_db.public.instacart_total_orders . Multiple phrase match : When you enter two or more keywords, Atlan will find assets with asset names that partially match the keywords or a combination of them to narrow down the search results. See only what you want to see ​ Atlan gives you the option to customize your search. Want to show or hide certain fields in your search results?

    "content": "Get Started References The DataOps Culture Code On this page The DataOps Culture Code We experimented for two years, across 200 data projects, to create our own viewpoint of what makes data teams successful. We've codified these learnings into what we call the \"DataOps Culture Code\". The data team is the most interdisciplinary team in any organization. Data Scientists, Analysts, Engineers, Business Users ... These are diverse people, with diverse tools, skillsets, and DNA. All doing diverse things. Sometimes they're asking open-ended questions to get to the bottom of “why”, just like a scientist in a research lab. Sometimes they're working on scaling petabyte-sized data processing systems, like a software engineer. Add to all this the living and breathing thing that is... data . Unlike code or design, it's constantly changing. How do you make a data team successful? ​ There's no easy answer. We started as a data team ourselves, on a quest to make ourselves as agile as we could. We borrowed the principles of Agile from product teams, DevOps from engineering teams, and Lean Manufacturing from supply chain teams. We then experimented for two years, across 200 data projects, to create our own idea of what makes data teams successful. These principles are the foundation of everything we build at Atlan. The DataOps Culture Code ​ 🤝 It’s a team sport, and collaboration is key ​ Data teams will always have a variety of roles, each with their own skills, favorite tools and DNA. Embrace the diversity, and create mechanisms for effective collaboration. 🗄 Treat data, code, models and dashboards as assets. ​ All data assets - from code and models to data and dashboards - are assets, and they should be treated like assets. Assets should be easily discoverable. Assets should be maintained. Assets should be easily reusable. 🚀 Optimize for agility ​ In today’s world, as business needs evolve rapidly, data teams need to be a step ahead, not deluged with three months of backlog. Constantly measure your team’s velocity, and invest in foundational initiatives to improve cycle times. Reduce dependencies between business, analysts and engineers. Enable a documentation-first culture. Automate whatever is repetitive. 👥 Create systems of trust ​ With the inherent diversity of data teams, it's all too easy to misunderstand other team members' roles. But that creates trust deficiencies - especially when things go wrong! Intentionally create systems of trust in your team. Make everyone’s work accessible and discoverable to break down \"tool\" silos. Create transparency in data pipelines and lineage so everyone can see and troubleshoot issues. Set up monitoring and alerting systems to proactively know when things break. 🖇️ Create a plug-and-play data stack ​ The data ecosystem will rapidly evolve. The tools, technology and infrastructure you use today will (and should) be different from the tools you use two years later. Your data stack should allow your team to experiment and innovate as technology evolves, without creating lock-ins. Embrace tools that are open and extensible. Leverage a strong metadata layer to tie diverse tooling together. ✨ User experience defines adoption velocity ​ Employees at Airbnb famously said, \"Designing the interface and user experience of a data tool should not be an afterthought.\" Without good user experience, the best tools or most thoughtful processes won't be adopted in your team. Invest in user experience, even for internal tools. It will define adoption velocity! Invest in simple and intuitive tools. Software shouldn't need training programs.

    "content": "Configure Atlan Data Products Concepts What are data products? On this page Data Products ➕ Available via the Data Marketplace package From a single data table to a collection of data assets, anything can be a data product in Atlan. Data products provide a framework for your teams to curate assets specific to a domain, business unit, region of operation, brand, and more. These curated data products then empower your data consumers to easily discover data assets, quickly get the context they need, and collaborate more efficiently. As organizations shift from centralized data architectures, build a new paradigm of governance with data products in Atlan. Enable products module ​ Who can do this? You will need to be an admin user in Atlan to enable the products module for your organization. To enable data products for your Atlan users: From the left  of any screen in Atlan, click Admin . Under the Workspace heading, click Labs . On the Labs page, turn on Products module to enable your users to create and manage data domains and products . In the Who can access Products module dialog, you can configure access to the module for the following sets of users: Click Only admins to enable the products module for admin users only. Click Selected personas to enable the products module for specific personas with domain policies . Select the persona(s) to which you want to limit usage of the products module. If there are no personas with domain policies, you can either create a new persona with a domain policy or add a domain policy to an existing persona. Include all admins is selected by default. This allows any admin user to access and manage the module irrespective of whether they belong to the specified personas. (Optional) Uncheck the Include all admins checkbox to remove the default selection. Click All users and personas to enable the products module for all your Atlan users and personas. (Optional) Click Configure to update your user selections for access to the module. (Optional) To hide the product scorecard on your data products, turn off Product score . (Optional) To enable your users to search for data products from asset discovery , turn on Show products in asset discovery . If you'd like to disable the Products module from your organization's Atlan workspace, follow the steps above to turn it off. Once enabled, you can also temporarily disable the module and turn it on again as needed. For any domains and products you may have created, this will not result in any data loss. Order of operations ​ To start using data products, you will need to: Create a data domain (Optional) Add data subdomains Create domain policies Create data products within the data domain Discover and collaborate on data products Track and monitor domain usage Stakeholders ​ Atlan currently supports adding predefined stakeholders and creating custom ones for your data domains and subdomains. These are responsibilities you can assign to your users based on their function within a specific domain or subdomain. Stakeholders do not enforce access control, but are meant to help your data consumers understand the organizational structure and responsibilities. Atlan provides the following options: Domain owner - overall domain management and reporting. Architect - design and deployment of domains and subdomains. Data product owner - creation, management, and documentation of data products. Data engineer - creation and management of data pipelines. Create new stakeholders that better reflect your organizational structure and functions. Components of a data product ​ To search for a data product: From the left  of any screen in Atlan, you can either: Click Products to search for data products from the products page: From the left  , use the search bar or select the relevant domain and then select a data product.

    "title": "Authentication and authorization | Atlan Documentation",
    "content": "Get Started Core Concepts Authentication and authorization On this page Authentication and authorization Atlan supports the following authentication methods: Basic authentication ​ Atlan initially comes with basic or username-password authentication. Admins can invite new users to log into Atlan. When a new user opens the invitation link, they will be able to set up their user profile, including username and password. However, Atlan does not recommend using basic authentication. Instead, admins should configure and enforce SSO authentication . SSO authentication ​ SSO using SAML 2.0 ​ Atlan supports single sign-on (SSO), allowing admins to configure SSO authentication. Atlan currently supports the following SSO providers: Azure AD Google JumpCloud Okta OneLogin Custom IdP SSO using SCIM ​ System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) provisioning works in combination with SSO. Atlan currently supports SCIM provisioning for the following SSO providers: Azure AD Okta Authorization ​ Role-based access control (RBAC) ​ Atlan implements role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure that users have the minimum level of access required to perform their tasks. Access rights are assigned based on roles, and users are granted permissions according to their responsibilities. A system owner or an authorized party must approve any additional permissions. Atlan adheres to the principle of least privilege, ensuring that users are only granted the level of access necessary to perform their job functions. User access review (UAR) ​ Atlan recommends that admins perform access reviews of users, admins, and service accounts on a quarterly basis to ensure that appropriate access levels are maintained. Access reviews should also be documented. Identity and access management ​ For centralized management of groups and users, Atlan uses granular access policies . Admins can define policies to control both which actions a user can take and against which assets. These can be as broad as entire databases down to individual columns. Organizations can even build policies based on asset classification. This opens up the ability to restrict access to sensitive data like Personally Identifiable Information (PII) - an essential feature in the GDPR era. Atlan denies access by default , and explicit denials override any grants . You can even deny admin users access to assets, if you want. Roles ​ You must assign every user in Atlan a user role . These control basic levels of access. Groups ​ You can also add users to groups . Groups provide a more maintainable mechanism for applying access controls. Policies ​ You can define access policies for both users and groups. Through these policies you can restrict which users can take which actions on which assets. For example, you can set up tags such as PII and apply this to data assets like tables. You can also configure the tag to propagate downstream to any columns or tables created from them. You can then define access controls based on these tags to restrict access to tagged assets. If Atlan propagates tags for you to derived assets, the access control is automatically applied to those derived assets as well.

    "content": "Build governance Tags Tag Management Attach a tag On this page Attach a tag Atlan allows users to add tags to assets. You can use them to identify key characteristics of assets or group them together for usage or data protection. Atlan also supports attaching tags imported from the following supported sources: Databricks dbt Google BigQuery Snowflake For tags created in Atlan, these are displayed in sentence case by design in the governance center, asset , and tags filter. For imported tags, Atlan will display the source version only in the tag popover when you hover over the tag in the asset . Did you know? Tag propagation is disabled by default in Atlan. You can enable tag propagation to child and downstream assets. Directly tag an asset ​ To directly tag an asset: In the left  from any screen in Atlan, click Assets . On the Assets page, click an asset to view its asset profile. Under Tags in the right , click the + icon. In the popup, check the boxes to select one or more tags for the asset. No propagation is the default setting. Next to your selected tag(s) in the popup, click Edit to configure the propagation of tags: Click Hierarchy & lineage to allow propagation of tags to the child and downstream assets. Click Hierarchy only (no lineage) to allow propagation of tags to the child assets only. Click No propagation to disallow any propagation of tags.

Under Snowflake tags , select a synced Snowflake tag and then: Click the Select tag value dropdown to attach an allowed value from a predefined list, if available. For Add value , enter a tag value of your choice, if no predefined allowed values are present. Tag values added in Atlan are case-sensitive. For dbt Cloud or dbt Core assets, you can attach a dbt tag . For Google BigQuery assets, you can attach a Google BigQuery tag . For Databricks assets, you can attach a Databricks tag and tag values. If reverse sync is enabled , any updates made in Atlan will also be synced to Databricks. If reverse sync is disabled, updates will be restricted to Atlan. danger If there are multiple synced tags mapped to an Atlan tag , you will only be able to select one synced tag. You can also only select imported tags that belong to the same connection as the selected asset. Click Update to confirm your selections. Click Save to save the tag(s) to your asset. (Optional) Hover over the attached tag to view tag propagation details in a popover, including username of the user who applied the tag, mode of tag propagation, and when the tag was configured. (Optional) Filter tagged assets by attached tags , including tags imported from supported sources. For reverse sync to work for tags imported from Snowflake and Databricks , first ensure that reverse sync is enabled on the imported tag and then you must attach the imported tag to the asset (complete step 6 above). Did you know? You can remove tags from your tagged assets. You can also add tags to your column assets directly from Google Sheets.

Direct extraction IAM user authentication IAM role authentication Offline extraction Re-run existing workflow /api/service/workflows/indexsearch (POST) /api/service/workflows/submit (POST) Postgres assets package ¶ The Postgres assets package crawls PostgreSQL assets and publishes them to Atlan for discovery. Direct extraction ¶ Will create a new connection This should only be used to create the workflow the first time. Each time you run this method it will create a new connection and new assets within that connection — which could lead to duplicate assets if you run the workflow this way multiple times with the same settings. Instead, when you want to re-crawl assets, re-run the existing workflow (see Re-run existing workflow below). 4.0.0 7.0.0 To crawl assets directly from PostgreSQL using basic authentication: Java Python Kotlin Raw REST API Direct extraction from PostgreSQL 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 Workflow postgres = PostgreSQLCrawler . directBasicAuth ( // (1) \"production\" , // (2) \"postgres.x9f0ve2k1kvy.ap-south-1.rds.amazonaws.com\" , // (3) 5432 , // (4) \"postgres\" , // (5) \"nCkM685ZH9g4fVICMs6H\" , // (6) \"demo_db\" , // (7) List . of ( client . getRoleCache (). getIdForName ( \"$admin\" )), // (8) null , null , true , // (9) true , // (10) 10000L , // (11) Map . of ( \"demo_db\" , List . of ( \"demo\" )), // (12) null ); // (13) WorkflowResponse response = postgres . run (); // (14) The PostgreSQLCrawler package will create a workflow to crawl assets from PostgreSQL. The directBasicAuth() method creates a workflow for crawling assets directly from PostgreSQL. You must provide a name for the connection that the PostgreSQL assets will exist within. You must provide the hostname of your PostgreSQL instance. You must specify the port number of the PostgreSQL instance (use 5432 for the default). You must provide your PostgreSQL username. You must provide your PostgreSQL password. You must specify the name of the PostgreSQL database you want to crawl. You must specify at least one connection admin, either: everyone in a role (in this example, all $admin users) a list of groups (names) that will be connection admins a list of users (names) that will be connection admins You can specify whether you want to allow queries to this connection ( true , as in this example) or deny all query access to the connection ( false ). You can specify whether you want to allow data previews on this connection ( true , as in this example) or deny all sample data previews to the connection ( false ). You can specify a maximum number of rows that can be accessed for any asset in the connection. You can also optionally specify the set of assets to include in crawling. For PostgreSQL assets, this should be specified as a map keyed by database name with values as a list of schemas within that database to crawl. (If set to null, all databases and schemas will be crawled.) You can also optionally specify the list of assets to exclude from crawling. For PostgreSQL assets, this should be specified as a map keyed by database name with values as a list of schemas within the database to exclude. (If set to null, no assets will be excluded.) You can then run the workflow using the run() method on the object you've created. Because this operation will execute work in Atlan, you must provide it an AtlanClient through which to connect to the tenant. Workflows run asynchronously Remember that workflows run asynchronously. See the packages and workflows introduction for details on how you can check the status and wait until the workflow has been completed. Direct extraction from PostgreSQL using basic auth 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 from pyatlan.client.atlan import AtlanClient from pyatlan.model.packages import PostgresCrawler client = AtlanClient () crawler = ( PostgresCrawler ( # (1) client = client , # (2) connection_name = \"production\" , # (3) admin_roles = [ client . role_cache . get_id_for_name ( \"$admin\" )], # (4) admin_groups = None , admin_users = None , row_limit = 10000 , # (5) allow_query = True , # (6) allow_query_preview = True , # (7) ) . direct ( hostname = \"test.com\" , database = \"test-db\" ) # (8) . basic_auth ( # (9) username = \"test-user\" , password = \"test-password\" , ) . include ( assets = { \"test-include\" : [ \"test-asset-1\" , \"test-asset-2\" ]}) # (10) . exclude ( assets = None ) # (11) . exclude_regex ( regex = \".*_TEST\" ) # (12) . source_level_filtering ( enable = True ) # (13) . jdbc_internal_methods ( enable = True ) # (14) . to_workflow () # (15) ) response = client . workflow . run ( crawler ) # (16) Base configuration for a new PostgresCrawler crawler. You must provide a client instance. You must provide a name for the connection that the PostgreSQL assets will exist within. You must specify at least one connection admin , either: everyone in a role (in this example, all $admin users). a list of groups (names) that will be connection admins. a list of users (names) that will be connection admins. You can specify a maximum number of rows that can be accessed for any asset in the connection. You can specify whether you want to allow queries to this connection. ( True , as in this example) or deny all query access to the connection ( False ). You can specify whether you want to allow data previews on this connection ( True , as in this example) or deny all sample data previews to the connection ( False ). You can specify the hostname of your Postgres instance and database name for direct extraction. When using basic_auth() , you need to provide the following information: username through which to access PostgreSQL. password through which to access PostgreSQL. You can also optionally specify the set of assets to include in crawling. For Postgres assets, this should be specified as a dict keyed by database name with each value being a list of schemas to include. (If set to None, all table will be crawled.) You can also optionally specify the list of assets to exclude from crawling. For Postgres assets, this should be specified as a dict keyed by database name with each value being a list of schemas to exclude. (If set to None, no table will be excluded.) You can also optionally specify the exclude regex for crawler ignore tables and views based on a naming convention. You can also optionally specify whether to enable ( True ) or disable ( False ) schema level filtering on source, schemas selected in the include filter will be fetched. You can also optionally specify whether to enable ( True ) or disable ( False ) JDBC internal methods for data extraction. Now, you can convert the package into a Workflow object. Run the workflow by invoking the run() method on the workflow client, passing the created object. Workflows run asynchronously Remember that workflows run asynchronously. See the packages and workflows introduction for details on how you can check the status and wait until the workflow has been completed.

See the packages and workflows introduction for details on how you can check the status and wait until the workflow has been completed. Create the workflow via UI only We recommend creating the workflow only via the UI. To rerun an existing workflow, see the steps below. IAM user authentication ¶ Will create a new connection This should only be used to create the workflow the first time. Each time you run this method it will create a new connection and new assets within that connection — which could lead to duplicate assets if you run the workflow this way multiple times with the same settings. Instead, when you want to re-crawl assets, re-run the existing workflow (see Re-run existing workflow below). 7.0.0 To crawl assets directly from PostgreSQL using IAM user authentication: Java Python Raw REST API Coming soon PostgreSQL assets crawling using IAM user authentication 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 from pyatlan.client.atlan import AtlanClient from pyatlan.model.packages import PostgresCrawler client = AtlanClient () crawler = ( PostgresCrawler ( # (1) client = client , # (2) connection_name = \"production\" , # (3) admin_roles = [ client . role_cache . get_id_for_name ( \"$admin\" )], # (4) admin_groups = None , admin_users = None , row_limit = 10000 , # (5) allow_query = True , # (6) allow_query_preview = True , # (7) ) . direct ( hostname = \"test.com\" , database = \"test-db\" ) # (8) . iam_user_auth ( # (9) username = \"test-user\" , access_key = \"test-access-key\" , secret_key = \"test-secret-key\" , ) . include ( assets = { \"test-include\" : [ \"test-asset-1\" , \"test-asset-2\" ]}) # (10) . exclude ( assets = None ) # (11) . exclude_regex ( regex = \".*_TEST\" ) # (12) . source_level_filtering ( enable = True ) # (13) . jdbc_internal_methods ( enable = True ) # (14) . to_workflow () # (15) ) response = client . workflow . run ( crawler ) # (16) Base configuration for a new PostgresCrawler crawler. You must provide a client instance. You must provide a name for the connection that the PostgreSQL assets will exist within. You must specify at least one connection admin , either: everyone in a role (in this example, all $admin users). a list of groups (names) that will be connection admins. a list of users (names) that will be connection admins. You can specify a maximum number of rows that can be accessed for any asset in the connection. You can specify whether you want to allow queries to this connection.

You can specify whether you want to allow data previews on this connection ( True , as in this example) or deny all sample data previews to the connection ( False ). You can specify the hostname of your Postgres instance and database name for direct extraction. When using iam_user_auth() , you need to provide the following information: database username to extract from. access key through which to access PostgreSQL. secret key through which to access PostgreSQL. You can also optionally specify the set of assets to include in crawling. For Postgres assets, this should be specified as a dict keyed by database name with each value being a list of schemas to include. (If set to None, all table will be crawled.) You can also optionally specify the list of assets to exclude from crawling. For Postgres assets, this should be specified as a dict keyed by database name with each value being a list of schemas to exclude. (If set to None, no table will be excluded.)

You can also optionally specify whether to enable ( True ) or disable ( False ) schema level filtering on source, schemas selected in the include filter will be fetched. You can also optionally specify whether to enable ( True ) or disable ( False ) JDBC internal methods for data extraction. Now, you can convert the package into a Workflow object. Run the workflow by invoking the run() method on the workflow client, passing the created object. Workflows run asynchronously Remember that workflows run asynchronously.

See the packages and workflows introduction for details on how you can check the status and wait until the workflow has been completed. Create the workflow via UI only We recommend creating the workflow only via the UI. To rerun an existing workflow, see the steps below. Re-run existing workflow ¶ 4.0.0 To re-run an existing workflow for PostgreSQL assets: Java Python Kotlin Raw REST API Re-run existing PostgreSQL workflow 1 2 3 4 List < WorkflowSearchResult > existing = WorkflowSearchRequest // (1) . findByType ( client , PostgreSQLCrawler . PREFIX , 5 ); // (2) // Determine which of the results is the PostgreSQL workflow you want to re-run... WorkflowRunResponse response = existing . get ( n ). rerun ( client ); // (3) You can search for existing workflows through the WorkflowSearchRequest class. You can find workflows by their type using the findByType() helper method and providing the prefix for one of the packages. In this example, we do so for the PostgreSQLCrawler . (You can also specify the maximum number of resulting workflows you want to retrieve as results.) Once you've found the workflow you want to re-run, you can simply call the rerun() helper method on the workflow search result. The WorkflowRunResponse is just a subtype of WorkflowResponse so has the same helper method to monitor progress of the workflow run. Because this operation will execute work in Atlan, you must provide it an AtlanClient through which to connect to the tenant. Optionally, you can use the rerun(client, true) method with idempotency to avoid re-running a workflow that is already in running or in a pending state. This will return details of the already running workflow if found, and by default, it is set to false Workflows run asynchronously Remember that workflows run asynchronously. See the packages and workflows introduction for details on how you can check the status and wait until the workflow has been completed. Re-run existing DynamoDB workflow 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 from pyatlan.client.atlan import AtlanClient from pyatlan.model.enums import WorkflowPackage client = AtlanClient () existing = client . workflow . find_by_type ( # (1) prefix = WorkflowPackage . POSTGRES , max_results = 5 ) # Determine which DynamoDB workflow (n) # from the list of results you want to re-run. response = client . workflow . rerun ( existing [ n ]) # (2) You can find workflows by their type using the workflow client find_by_type() method and providing the prefix for one of the packages. In this example, we do so for the PostgreSQLCrawler . (You can also specify the maximum number of resulting workflows you want to retrieve as results.) Once you've found the workflow you want to re-run, you can simply call the workflow client rerun() method. Optionally, you can use rerun(idempotent=True) to avoid re-running a workflow that is already in running or in a pending state. This will return details of the already running workflow if found, and by default, it is set to False . Workflows run asynchronously Remember that workflows run asynchronously. See the packages and workflows introduction for details on how you can check the status and wait until the workflow has been completed. Re-run existing PostgreSQL workflow 1 2 3 4 val existing = WorkflowSearchRequest // (1) . findByType ( client , PostgreSQLCrawler .

See the packages and workflows introduction for details on how you can check the status and wait until the workflow has been completed. Requires multiple steps through the raw REST API Find the existing workflow. Send through the resulting re-run request. POST /api/service/workflows/indexsearch 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 { \"from\" : 0 , \"size\" : 5 , \"query\" : { \"bool\" : { \"filter\" : [ { \"nested\" : { \"path\" : \"metadata\" , \"query\" : { \"prefix\" : { \"metadata.name.keyword\" : { \"value\" : \"atlan-postgres\" // (1) } } } } } ] } }, \"sort\" : [ { \"metadata.creationTimestamp\" : { \"nested\" : { \"path\" : \"metadata\" }, \"order\" : \"desc\" } } ], \"track_total_hits\" : true } Searching by the atlan-postgres prefix will ensure you only find existing PostgreSQL assets workflows. Name of the workflow The name of the workflow will be nested within the _source.metadata.name property of the response object. (Remember since this is a search, there could be multiple results, so you may want to use the other details in each result to determine which workflow you really want.) POST /api/service/workflows/submit 100 101 102 103 104 { \"namespace\" : \"default\" , \"resourceKind\" : \"WorkflowTemplate\" , \"resourceName\" : \"atlan-postgres-1684500411\" // (1) } Send the name of the workflow as the resourceName to rerun it. 2022-12-28 2025-06-11 Was this page helpful?

TableauWorksheet ThoughtSpot ThoughtSpot ThoughtspotAnswer ThoughtspotColumn ThoughtspotDashlet ThoughtspotLiveboard ThoughtspotTable ThoughtspotView ThoughtspotWorksheet Endpoints CLASSIFICATION_ADD event type ¶ CLASSIFICATION_ADD events are emitted whenever a tag is added to an asset in Atlan. This includes: When a tag is added directly to an asset When a tag is propagated to an asset (asynchronously) One CLASSIFICATION_ADD event is emitted for each asset that is tagged So, for example, if you tag a term in Atlan that: Is linked to 1 table, Which has 2 downstream tables (in lineage), And also has 10 columns, 3 of which have 1 downstream column each (in lineage) Atlan will emit 17 CLASSIFICATION_ADD events. (Note that because the propagations occur asynchronously, it is unlikely these 17 events will be back-to-back (without other events in-between) in the event bus.) The details of the tagged asset will be in the message.entity portion of the event payload. The event payload shows the tag that was added in the message.mutatedDetails portion of the event payload. Tags use internal Atlan IDs Also note that the tag names use Atlan's internal IDs in the event payload. You will need to translate these to the human-readable names you see in the Atlan UI. (The SDKs provide operations to do these lookups.) Example CLASSIFICATION_ADD event 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 { \"source\" : {}, \"version\" : { \"version\" : \"1.0.0\" , \"versionParts\" : [ 1 ] }, \"msgCompressionKind\" : \"NONE\" , \"msgSplitIdx\" : 1 , \"msgSplitCount\" : 1 , \"msgSourceIP\" : \"10.121.193.228\" , \"msgCreatedBy\" : \"\" , \"msgCreationTime\" : 1666964451608 , \"spooled\" : false , \"message\" : { \"type\" : \"ENTITY_NOTIFICATION_V2\" , \"entity\" : { \"typeName\" : \"Column\" , \"attributes\" : { \"popularityScore\" : 1.17549435e-38 , \"lastSyncRunAt\" : 1666792022425 , \"databaseName\" : \"FIVETRAN\" , \"precision\" : 18 , \"lastSyncRun\" : \"atlan-snowflake-1666769582-55jct\" , \"schemaName\" : \"POSTGRES_RDS_DEMO_DEV\" , \"tableName\" : \"INSTACART_UNIQUE_USERS\" , \"adminUsers\" : [], \"queryUserCount\" : 0 , \"sourceUpdatedAt\" : 0 , \"assetDbtJobLastRunArtifactsSaved\" : false , \"isEditable\" : true , \"isPartition\" : false , \"announcementUpdatedAt\" : 0 , \"order\" : 1 , \"sourceCreatedAt\" : 0 , \"assetDbtJobLastRunDequedAt\" : 0 , \"assetDbtTags\" : [], \"isIndexed\" : false , \"qualifiedName\" : \"default/snowflake/1666769582/FIVETRAN/POSTGRES_RDS_DEMO_DEV/INSTACART_UNIQUE_USERS/TOTAL_USER\" , \"dataType\" : \"NUMBER\" , \"assetDbtJobLastRunNotificationsSent\" : false , \"isClustered\" : false , \"isNullable\" : false , \"name\" : \"TOTAL_USER\" , \"certificateUpdatedAt\" : 0 , \"connectorName\" : \"snowflake\" , \"numericScale\" : 0 , \"maxLength\" : 0 , \"ownerUsers\" : [], \"isSort\" : false , \"lastSyncWorkflowName\" : \"activate-poc-crawler\" , \"connectionQualifiedName\" : \"default/snowflake/1666769582\" , \"assetDbtJobLastRunHasSourcesGenerated\" : false , \"isForeign\" : false , \"assetDbtJobLastRunHasDocsGenerated\" : false , \"queryCount\" : 0 , \"pinnedAt\" : 0 , \"isDist\" : false , \"assetDbtJobLastRunUpdatedAt\" : 0 , \"ownerGroups\" : [], \"isPrimary\" : false , \"assetDbtJobLastRunStartedAt\" : 0 , \"isDiscoverable\" : true , \"schemaQualifiedName\" : \"default/snowflake/1666769582/FIVETRAN/POSTGRES_RDS_DEMO_DEV\" , \"viewerUsers\" : [], \"adminRoles\" : [], \"adminGroups\" : [], \"isPinned\" : false , \"assetDbtJobLastRunCreatedAt\" : 0 , \"databaseQualifiedName\" : \"default/snowflake/1666769582/FIVETRAN\" , \"assetDbtJobNextRun\" : 0 , \"tableQualifiedName\" : \"default/snowflake/1666769582/FIVETRAN/POSTGRES_RDS_DEMO_DEV/INSTACART_UNIQUE_USERS\" , \"partitionOrder\" : 0 , \"viewerGroups\" : [], \"assetDbtJobLastRun\" : 0 }, \"guid\" : \"9065bba5-22b8-4331-bff8-1bdf017c5cfb\" , \"status\" : \"ACTIVE\" , \"displayText\" : \"TOTAL_USER\" , \"classificationNames\" : [ \"jUQpLPdg9hWoheH2eL9Ha2\" ], \"classifications\" : [ { \"typeName\" : \"jUQpLPdg9hWoheH2eL9Ha2\" , \"entityGuid\" : \"9065bba5-22b8-4331-bff8-1bdf017c5cfb\" , \"entityStatus\" : \"ACTIVE\" , \"propagate\" : true , \"removePropagationsOnEntityDelete\" : true , \"restrictPropagationThroughLineage\" : false , \"restrictPropagationThroughHierarchy\" : false } ], \"isIncomplete\" : false , \"createdBy\" : \"kartik.thakur\" , \"updatedBy\" : \"kartik.thakur\" , \"createTime\" : 1666792644294 , \"updateTime\" : 1666964451417 }, \"operationType\" : \"CLASSIFICATION_ADD\" , \"eventTime\" : 1666964451417 , \"mutatedDetails\" : [ { \"typeName\" : \"jUQpLPdg9hWoheH2eL9Ha2\" , \"entityGuid\" : \"9065bba5-22b8-4331-bff8-1bdf017c5cfb\" , \"entityStatus\" : \"ACTIVE\" , \"propagate\" : true , \"removePropagationsOnEntityDelete\" : true , \"restrictPropagationThroughLineage\" : false , \"restrictPropagationThroughHierarchy\" : false } ] } } 2022-11-07 2024-10-01 Was this page helpful?

stakeholderDataDomain (DataDomain) stakeholderTitle (StakeholderTitle) Stakeholder ¶ Atlan Type representing Stakeholders Complete reference This is a complete reference for the Stakeholder object in Atlan, showing every possible property and relationship that can exist for these objects. For an introduction, you probably want to start with: Snippets — small, atomic examples of single-step use cases. Patterns — walkthroughs of common multi-step implementation patterns. Stakeholder inherits its attributes and relationships from these other types: classDiagram direction RL class Stakeholder link Stakeholder \"../stakeholder\" class Persona link Persona \"../persona\" Persona <|-- Stakeholder : extends class AccessControl { <<abstract>> } link AccessControl \"../accesscontrol\" AccessControl <|-- Persona : extends class Asset { <<abstract>> } link Asset \"../asset\" Asset <|-- AccessControl : extends class Referenceable { <<abstract>> } link Referenceable \"../referenceable\" Referenceable <|-- Asset : extends Properties ¶ Inherited properties These attributes are inherited from Stakeholder 's supertypes (shown above): typeName ¶ Type of this asset. guid ¶ Globally-unique identifier for this asset. classifications ¶ Tags assigned to the asset.

For that, we would suggest starting with the manage Google Cloud Storage assets pattern . classDiagram direction RL class GCS { <<abstract>> } link GCS \"../gcs\" class Google { <<abstract>> } link Google \"../google\" Google <|-- GCS : extends class Cloud { <<abstract>> } link Cloud \"../entities/cloud\" Cloud <|-- Google : extends class Asset { <<abstract>> } link Asset \"../entities/asset\" Asset <|-- Cloud : extends class Referenceable { <<abstract>> } link Referenceable \"../entities/referenceable\" Referenceable <|-- Asset : extends class ObjectStore { <<abstract>> } link ObjectStore \"../entities/objectstore\" ObjectStore <|-- GCS : extends class Catalog { <<abstract>> } link Catalog \"../entities/catalog\" Catalog <|-- ObjectStore : extends Asset <|-- Catalog : extends class GCSObject link GCSObject \"../entities/gcsobject\" GCS <|-- GCSObject : extends class GCSBucket link GCSBucket \"../entities/gcsbucket\" GCS <|-- GCSBucket : extends Properties ¶ These attributes are specific to instances of GCS (and all of its subtypes). gcsAccessControl ¶ Access control list for this asset. gcsETag ¶ Entity tag for the asset. An entity tag is a hash of the object and represents changes to the contents of an object only, not its metadata. gcsEncryptionType ¶ Encryption algorithm used to encrypt this asset. gcsMetaGenerationId ¶ Version of metadata for this asset at this generation. Used for preconditions and detecting changes in metadata. A metageneration number is only meaningful in the context of a particular generation of a particular asset. gcsRequesterPays ¶ Whether the requester pays  was sent when this asset was created (true) or not (false). gcsStorageClass ¶ Storage class of this asset. Relationships ¶ The following illustrates how the various GCS objects inter-relate with each other: erDiagram Connection ||..o{ GCSBucket : \"\" GCSBucket ||--o{ GCSObject : gcsObjects 2023-07-07 2023-12-29 Was this page helpful?

Equivalent query from Elastic val byName = TermQuery . of ( t -> t . field ( \"name.keyword\" ) . value ( \"dev\" ) . caseInsensitive ( true )) . _toQuery () To ensure the details of this field are included in each result, add the field to includeOnResults() . Run the search 5 6 7 for ( result in index . search ( client )) { // (1) val name = result . name // (2) } For details, see Searching for assets . The name can be retrieved from a result through .name .

Soft-delete an asset Hard-delete an asset Bulk-delete assets /api/meta/entity/bulk (DELETE) Deleting assets ¶ Deleting an asset uses a similar pattern to the retrieval operations. For this you can use static methods provided by the Asset class. Avoid deleting connections If you want to delete a connection and all of its assets, consider using the connection delete package instead. In particular, avoid deleting a connection directly (using the methods below) without first deleting the assets contained within it. Once you delete a connection, you will be unable to delete any assets that were within it. Soft-delete an asset ¶ Soft-deletes (also called an archive ) are a reversible operation. The status of the asset is changed to DELETED and it no longer appears in the UI, but the asset is still present in Atlan's back-end. 1.4.0 4.0.0 To soft-delete (archive) an asset, you only need to provide the GUID: Java Python Kotlin Raw REST API Soft-delete an asset 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 AssetMutationResponse response = Asset . delete ( client , \"b4113341-251b-4adc-81fb-2420501c30e6\" ); // (1) Asset deleted = response . getDeletedAssets (). get ( 0 ); // (2) Glossary glossary ; if ( deleted instanceof Glossary ) { glossary = ( Glossary ) deleted ; // (3) } The delete() method returns the deleted form of the asset. Because this operation will archive the asset in Atlan, you must provide it an AtlanClient through which to connect to the tenant. You can distinguish what was deleted through the getDeletedAssets() method. This lists only the assets deleted by the operation. The Asset class is a superclass of all assets. So you need to cast to more specific types (like Glossary ) after verifying the object that was actually returned. Soft-delete an asset 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 from pyatlan.client.atlan import AtlanClient from pyatlan.model.assets import AtlasGlossary client = AtlanClient () response = client . asset . delete_by_guid ( \"b4113341-251b-4adc-81fb-2420501c30e6\" ) # (1) if deleted := response . assets_deleted ( asset_type = AtlasGlossary ): # (2) term = deleted [ 0 ] # (3) The asset.delete_by_guid() method returns the deleted form of the asset. The assets_deleted(asset_type=AtlasGlossary) method returns a list of the assets of the given type that were deleted. If an asset of the given type was deleted, then the deleted form of the asset is available. Soft-delete an asset 1 2 3 4 val response = Asset . delete ( client , \"b4113341-251b-4adc-81fb-2420501c30e6\" ) // (1) val deleted = response . deletedAssets [ 0 ] // (2) val glossary = if ( deleted is Glossary ) deleted else null // (3) The delete() method returns the deleted form of the asset. Because this operation will archive the asset in Atlan, you must provide it an AtlanClient through which to connect to the tenant. You can distinguish what was deleted through the deletedAssets method. This lists only the assets deleted by the operation. The Asset class is a superclass of all assets. So you need to cast to more specific types (like Glossary ) after verifying the object that was actually returned. DELETE /api/meta/entity/bulk?guid=b4113341-251b-4adc-81fb-2420501c30e6&deleteType=SOFT 1 // (1) In the case of deleting an asset, all necessary information is included in the URL of the request. There is no payload for the body of the request. To archive an asset, use deleteType of SOFT . Hard-delete an asset ¶ Hard-deletes (also called a purge ) are irreversible operations. The asset is removed from Atlan entirely, so no longer appears in the UI and also no longer exists in Atlan's back-end. 1.4.0 4.0.0 To hard-delete (purge) an asset, you only need to provide the GUID: Java Python Kotlin Raw REST API Hard-delete (purge) an asset 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 AssetMutationResponse response = Asset . purge ( client , \"b4113341-251b-4adc-81fb-2420501c30e6\" ); // (1) Asset deleted = response . getDeletedAssets (). get ( 0 ); // (2) Glossary glossary ; if ( deleted instanceof Glossary ) { glossary = ( Glossary ) deleted ; // (3) } The purge() method returns the purged form of the asset. Because this operation will remove the asset from Atlan, you must provide it an AtlanClient through which to connect to the tenant. You can distinguish what was purged through the getDeletedAssets() method. This lists only the assets deleted by the operation. The Asset class is a superclass of all assets. So you need to cast to more specific types (like Glossary ) after verifying the object that was actually returned. Hard-delete (purge) an asset 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 from pyatlan.client.atlan import AtlanClient from pyatlan.model.assets import AtlasGlossary client = AtlanClient () response = client . asset . purge_by_guid ( \"b4113341-251b-4adc-81fb-2420501c30e6\" ) # (1) if deleted := response . assets_deleted ( asset_type = AtlasGlossary ): # (2) term = deleted [ 0 ] # (3) The asset.purge_by_guid() method returns the deleted form of the asset. The assets_deleted(asset_type=AtlasGlossary) method returns a list of the assets of the given type that were deleted. If an asset of the given type was deleted, then the deleted form of the asset is available. Hard-delete (purge) an asset 1 2 3 4 val response = Asset . purge ( client , \"b4113341-251b-4adc-81fb-2420501c30e6\" ) // (1) val deleted = response . deletedAssets [ 0 ] // (2) val glossary = if ( deleted is Glossary ) deleted else null // (3) The purge() method returns the purged form of the asset. Because this operation will remove the asset from Atlan, you must provide it an AtlanClient through which to connect to the tenant. You can distinguish what was purged through the deletedAssets method. This lists only the assets deleted by the operation. The Asset class is a superclass of all assets. So you need to cast to more specific types (like Glossary ) after verifying the object that was actually returned. DELETE /api/meta/entity/bulk?guid=b4113341-251b-4adc-81fb-2420501c30e6&deleteType=PURGE 1 // (1) In the case of deleting an asset, all necessary information is included in the URL of the request. There is no payload for the body of the request. To permanently and irreversibly remove an asset, use deleteType of PURGE . Bulk-delete assets ¶ 1.4.0 1.0.0 You can also delete a number of assets at the same time: Up to a limit You cannot send an unlimited number of assets to be deleted in a single request. As you can see from the Raw REST API tab, each GUID will be sent as a query parameter in the URI — so there is a maximum beyond which the URI is too long. We generally recommend sending no more than 20-50 GUIDs at a time using this approach. Java Python Kotlin Raw REST API Hard-delete (purge) multiple assets 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 AssetMutationResponse response = client . assets . delete ( // (1) List . of ( \"b4113341-251b-4adc-81fb-2420501c30e6\" , // (2) \"21e5be62-7a0b-4547-ab7a-6ddf273d0640\" , \"a0fb35e5-690d-4a5b-8918-9ee267c8fa55\" ), AtlanDeleteType . PURGE ); // (3) List < Asset > deleted = response . getDeletedAssets (); // (4) The delete() method on the endpoint itself can be used to either archive (soft-delete) or purge (hard-delete). You can provide a list of any number of assets to delete (their GUIDs). You need to also specify whether you want to soft-delete (archive) using AtlanDeleteType.SOFT or hard-delete (purge) the assets using AtlanDeleteType.PURGE .

/api/service/workflows/indexsearch (POST) /api/service/workflows/submit (POST) Confluent Kafka assets package ¶ The Confluent Kafka assets package crawls Confluent Kafka assets and publishes them to Atlan for discovery. Direct extraction ¶ Will create a new connection This should only be used to create the workflow the first time. Each time you run this method it will create a new connection and new assets within that connection — which could lead to duplicate assets if you run the workflow this way multiple times with the same settings. Instead, when you want to re-crawl assets, re-run the existing workflow (see Re-run existing workflow below). 7.0.0 4.0.0 To crawl assets directly from Confluent Kafka: Java Python Kotlin Raw REST API Direct extraction from Confluent Kafka 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 Workflow crawler = ConfluentKafkaCrawler . creator ( // (1) client , // (2) \"production\" , // (3) List . of ( client . getRoleCache (). getIdForName ( \"$admin\" )), // (4) null , null ) . direct ( // (5) \"dev-south.aws.confluent.cloud:9092\" , true ) . apiToken ( \"api-key-here\" , // (6) \"api-secret-here\" // (7) ) . skipInternal ( true ) // (8) . include ( \".*_DEV_TOPICS\" ) // (9) . exclude ( \".*_TEST\" ) // (10) . build () // (11) . toWorkflow (); // (12) WorkflowResponse response = crawler . run ( client ); // (13) The ConfluentKafkaCrawler package will create a workflow to crawl assets from Confluent Kafka. You must provide Atlan client. You must provide a name for the connection that the Confluent Kafka assets will exist within. You must specify at least one connection admin , either: everyone in a role (in this example, all $admin users). a list of groups (names) that will be connection admins. a list of users (names) that will be connection admins. When crawling assets directly from Confluent Kafka, you are required to provide the following information: hostname and port number (host.example.com:9092) for the Kafka bootstrap server. whether to use an encrypted SSL connection ( true ), or plaintext ( false ) You must provide an API key through which to access Kafka. You must provide API secret through which to access Kafka. You can also optionally set whether to skip internal topics when crawling ( true ) or include them ( false ). You can also optionally provide the regular expression to use for including topics when crawling. You can also optionally provide the regular expression to use for excluding topics when crawling. Build the minimal package object. Now, you can convert the package into a Workflow object. You can then run the workflow using the run() method on the object you've created. Because this operation will execute work in Atlan, you must provide it an AtlanClient through which to connect to the tenant. Workflows run asynchronously Remember that workflows run asynchronously. See the packages and workflows introduction for details on how you can check the status and wait until the workflow has been completed.

You must provide API secret through which to access Kafka. You can also optionally set whether to skip internal topics when crawling ( True ) or include them ( False ). You can also optionally provide the regular expression to use for including topics when crawling. (If set to None, all topics will be crawled.) You can also optionally provide the regular expression to use for excluding topics when crawling. (If set to None, no topics will be excluded.) Now, you can convert the package into a Workflow object. Run the workflow by invoking the run() method on the workflow client, passing the created object. Workflows run asynchronously Remember that workflows run asynchronously. See the packages and workflows introduction for details on how you can check the status and wait until the workflow has been completed.

See the packages and workflows introduction for details on how you can check the status and wait until the workflow has been completed. Create the workflow via UI only We recommend creating the workflow only via the UI. To rerun an existing workflow, see the steps below. Re-run existing workflow ¶ 1.9.5 4.0.0 To re-run an existing workflow for Confluent Kafka assets: Java Python Kotlin Raw REST API Re-run existing Confluent Kafka workflow 1 2 3 4 List < WorkflowSearchResult > existing = WorkflowSearchRequest // (1) . findByType ( client , ConfluentKafkaCrawler . PREFIX , 5 ); // (2) // Determine which of the results is the Confluent Kafka workflow you want to re-run... WorkflowRunResponse response = existing . get ( n ). rerun ( client ); // (3) You can search for existing workflows through the WorkflowSearchRequest class. You can find workflows by their type using the findByType() helper method and providing the prefix for one of the packages. In this example, we do so for the ConfluentKafkaCrawler . (You can also specify the maximum number of resulting workflows you want to retrieve as results.) Once you've found the workflow you want to re-run, you can simply call the rerun() helper method on the workflow search result. The WorkflowRunResponse is just a subtype of WorkflowResponse so has the same helper method to monitor progress of the workflow run. Because this operation will execute work in Atlan, you must provide it an AtlanClient through which to connect to the tenant. Optionally, you can use the rerun(client, true) method with idempotency to avoid re-running a workflow that is already in running or in a pending state. This will return details of the already running workflow if found, and by default, it is set to false Workflows run asynchronously Remember that workflows run asynchronously. See the packages and workflows introduction for details on how you can check the status and wait until the workflow has been completed. Re-run existing Confluent Kafka workflow 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 from pyatlan.client.atlan import AtlanClient from pyatlan.model.enums import WorkflowPackage client = AtlanClient () existing = client . workflow . find_by_type ( # (1) prefix = WorkflowPackage . KAFKA_CONFLUENT_CLOUD , max_results = 5 ) # Determine which Confluent Kafka workflow (n) # from the list of results you want to re-run. response = client . workflow . rerun ( existing [ n ]) # (2) You can find workflows by their type using the workflow client find_by_type() method and providing the prefix for one of the packages. In this example, we do so for the ConfluentKafkaCrawler . (You can also specify the maximum number of resulting workflows you want to retrieve as results.) Once you've found the workflow you want to re-run, you can simply call the workflow client rerun() method. Optionally, you can use rerun(idempotent=True) to avoid re-running a workflow that is already in running or in a pending state. This will return details of the already running workflow if found, and by default, it is set to False . Workflows run asynchronously Remember that workflows run asynchronously. See the packages and workflows introduction for details on how you can check the status and wait until the workflow has been completed. Re-run existing Confluent Kafka workflow 1 2 3 4 5 val existing = WorkflowSearchRequest // (1) . findByType ( client , ConfluentKafkaCrawler .

See the packages and workflows introduction for details on how you can check the status and wait until the workflow has been completed. Requires multiple steps through the raw REST API Find the existing workflow. Send through the resulting re-run request. POST /api/service/workflows/indexsearch 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 { \"from\" : 0 , \"size\" : 5 , \"query\" : { \"bool\" : { \"filter\" : [ { \"nested\" : { \"path\" : \"metadata\" , \"query\" : { \"prefix\" : { \"metadata.name.keyword\" : { \"value\" : \"atlan-kafka-confluent-cloud\" // (1) } } } } } ] } }, \"sort\" : [ { \"metadata.creationTimestamp\" : { \"nested\" : { \"path\" : \"metadata\" }, \"order\" : \"desc\" } } ], \"track_total_hits\" : true } Searching by the atlan-kafka-confluent-cloud prefix will ensure you only find existing Confluent Kafka assets workflows. Name of the workflow The name of the workflow will be nested within the _source.metadata.name property of the response object. (Remember since this is a search, there could be multiple results, so you may want to use the other details in each result to determine which workflow you really want.) POST /api/service/workflows/submit 100 101 102 103 104 { \"namespace\" : \"default\" , \"resourceKind\" : \"WorkflowTemplate\" , \"resourceName\" : \"atlan-kafka-confluent-cloud-1684500411\" // (1) } Send the name of the workflow as the resourceName to rerun it. 2023-12-29 2025-06-11 Was this page helpful?

Base class for IBM assets. Reference documentation This is reference documentation covering the entire Atlan model. It is not the best place to start when trying to understand integrating IBM assets with Atlan. For that, we would suggest starting with either: Snippets — small, atomic examples of single-step use cases. Patterns — walkthroughs of common multi-step implementation patterns. classDiagram direction RL class Catalog { <<abstract>> } link Catalog \"../catalog\" Catalog <|-- BI : extends class Asset { <<abstract>> } link Asset \"../asset\" Asset <|-- Catalog : extends class Referenceable { <<abstract>> } link Referenceable \"../entities/referenceable\" Referenceable <|-- Asset : extends class Cognos { <<abstract>> } link Cognos \"../cognos\" class BI { <<abstract>> } link BI \"../bi\" BI <|-- Cognos : extends class CognosExploration link CognosExploration \"../entities/cognosexploration\" Cognos <|-- CognosExploration : extends class CognosDashboard link CognosDashboard \"../entities/cognosdashboard\" Cognos <|-- CognosDashboard : extends class CognosReport link CognosReport \"../entities/cognosreport\" Cognos <|-- CognosReport : extends class CognosModule link CognosModule \"../entities/cognosmodule\" Cognos <|-- CognosModule : extends class CognosFile link CognosFile \"../entities/cognosfile\" Cognos <|-- CognosFile : extends class CognosFolder link CognosFolder \"../entities/cognosfolder\" Cognos <|-- CognosFolder : extends class CognosPackage link CognosPackage \"../entities/cognospackage\" Cognos <|-- CognosPackage : extends class CognosDatasource link CognosDatasource \"../entities/cognosdatasource\" Cognos <|-- CognosDatasource : extends 2024-06-18 2024-06-18 Was this page helpful?

Complete reference This is a complete reference for the DataverseAttribute object in Atlan, showing every possible property and relationship that can exist for these objects. For an introduction, you probably want to start with: Snippets — small, atomic examples of single-step use cases. Patterns — walkthroughs of common multi-step implementation patterns. DataverseAttribute inherits its attributes and relationships from these other types: classDiagram direction RL class DataverseAttribute link DataverseAttribute \"../dataverseattribute\" class Dataverse { <<abstract>> } link Dataverse \"../dataverse\" Dataverse <|-- DataverseAttribute : extends class SaaS { <<abstract>> } link SaaS \"../saas\" SaaS <|-- Dataverse : extends class Catalog { <<abstract>> } link Catalog \"../catalog\" Catalog <|-- SaaS : extends class Asset { <<abstract>> } link Asset \"../asset\" Asset <|-- Catalog : extends class Referenceable { <<abstract>> } link Referenceable \"../referenceable\" Referenceable <|-- Asset : extends Properties ¶ Inherited properties These attributes are inherited from DataverseAttribute 's supertypes (shown above): typeName ¶ Type of this asset. guid ¶ Globally-unique identifier for this asset. classifications ¶ Tags assigned to the asset. (1) Uses a different name in SDKs atlanTags atlan_tags For more information, see the tag assets snippets. businessAttributes ¶ Map of custom metadata attributes and values defined on the asset. (1) Uses a different name in SDKs customMetadataSets custom_metadata For more information, see the change custom metadata snippets. status ¶ Status of the asset. (1) Treat as read-only You should not try to set status on an asset. Instead, see the asset CRUD snippets on deleting and restoring assets. createdBy ¶ User or account that created the asset. updatedBy ¶ User or account that last updated the asset. createTime ¶ Time (epoch) at which the asset was created, in milliseconds. updateTime ¶ Time (epoch) at which the asset was last updated, in milliseconds. deleteHandler ¶ Details on the handler used for deletion of the asset. (1) Treat as read-only You should not try to set deleteHandler on an asset. Instead, see the asset CRUD snippets on deleting assets. classificationNames ¶ Hashed-string names of the Atlan tags that exist on the asset. (1) Uses a different name in SDKs atlanTagNames atlan_tag_names Use classifications to make changes to tags. isIncomplete ¶ Unused. meaningNames ¶ Human-readable names of terms that have been linked to this asset. meanings ¶ Details of terms that have been linked to this asset. (1) Do not use These should not be used, as they can be inconsistent. Instead, see the link terms and assets snippets. pendingTasks ¶ Unique identifiers (GUIDs) for any background tasks that are yet to operate on this asset. qualifiedName ¶ Unique name for this asset. This is typically a concatenation of the asset's name onto its parent's qualifiedName. This must be unique across all assets of the same type. adminGroups ¶ List of groups who administer this asset. (This is only used for certain asset types.) adminRoles ¶ List of roles who administer this asset. (This is only used for Connection assets.) adminUsers ¶ List of users who administer this asset. (This is only used for certain asset types.) announcementMessage ¶ Detailed message to include in the announcement on this asset. announcementTitle ¶ Brief title for the announcement on this asset. Required when announcementType is specified. announcementType ¶ Type of announcement on this asset. announcementUpdatedAt ¶ Time (epoch) at which the announcement was last updated, in milliseconds.

export (basic) package ¶ The asset export (basic) package identifies all assets that could have been enriched in some way through Atlan's UI and extracts them. The resulting CSV file can be modified or enriched, and then loaded back using the asset import package . All assets ¶ 2.6.0 In this example, we’re building and running the asset-export workflow to export all assets. However, you can also use one of the following methods to customize the scope of your asset export workflow: enriched_only() : sets up the package to export only assets enriched by users. glossaries_only() : sets up the package to export only glossaries. products_only() : sets up the package to export only data products. all_assets() : sets up the package to export all assets, whether enriched by users or not, will be exported. Java Python Kotlin Raw REST API Coming soon Import assets from the object store 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 from pyatlan.client.atlan import AtlanClient from pyatlan.model.packages import AssetExportBasic client = AtlanClient () workflow = ( AssetExportBasic () # (1) . all_assets ( # (2) prefix = \"default\" , include_description = True , include_glossaries = True , include_data_products = True , include_archived = True , ) . object_store ( prefix = \"/test/prefix\" ) # (3) . s3 ( # (4) access_key = \"test-access-key\" , secret_key = \"test-secret-key\" , bucket = \"my-bucket\" , region = \"us-west-1\" , ) ) . to_workflow () # (5) response = client . workflow . run ( workflow ) # (6) The AssetExportBasic package exports assets from Atlan. In this example, we’re building a workflow to export all_assets() . However, you can also use one of the following methods to customize the scope of your asset export workflow: enriched_only() : sets up the package to export only assets enriched by users. glossaries_only() : sets up the package to export only glossaries. products_only() : sets up the package to export only data products. all_assets() : sets up the package to export all assets, whether enriched by users or not, will be exported. For all_assets() , you need to provide following: prefix : starting value for a qualifiedName that will determine which assets to export, default: default (all data assets). include_description : whether to extract only user-entered description ( False ), or to also include system-level description ( True ). include_glossaries : whether glossaries (and their terms and categories) should be exported ( True ) or not ( False ). include_data_products : whether data products (and their domains) should be exported ( True ) or not ( False ). include_archived : whether to include archived assets in the export ( True ) or only active assets ( False ). To set up the package to export to an object storage location, you need to provide prefix : directory (path) within the object store where the exported file will be uploaded. In this example, we're exporting assets to an object storage location using s3() . However, you can use different object storage methods such as gcs() or adls() . You can also configure different export delivery methods using one of the following methods: email() : sets up the package to deliver the export via email. direct() : sets up the package to deliver the export via direct download. For s3() , you need to provide following: access_key : AWS access key. secret_key : AWS secret key. bucket : S3 bucket to upload the export file to. region : name of the AWS region. Convert the package into a Workflow object. Run the workflow by invoking the run() method on the workflow client, passing the created object. Workflows run asynchronously Remember that workflows run asynchronously. See the packages and workflows introduction for details on how to check the status and wait until the workflow has been completed. Coming soon Create the workflow via UI only We recommend creating the workflow only via the UI. To rerun an existing workflow, see the steps below. Re-run existing workflow ¶ 2.6.0 To re-run an existing asset export basic workflow: Java Python Kotlin Raw REST API Coming soon Re-run existing asset export basic workflow 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 from pyatlan.client.atlan import AtlanClient from pyatlan.model.enums import WorkflowPackage client = AtlanClient () existing = client . workflow . find_by_type ( # (1) prefix = WorkflowPackage . ASSET_EXPORT_BASIC , max_results = 5 ) # Determine which asset export basic workflow (n) # from the list of results you want to re-run. response = client . workflow . rerun ( existing [ n ]) # (2) You can find workflows by their type using the workflow client find_by_type() method and providing the prefix for one of the packages. In this example, we do so for the AssetExportBasic . (You can also specify the maximum number of resulting workflows you want to retrieve as results.) Once you've found the workflow you want to re-run, you can simply call the workflow client rerun() method. Optionally, you can use rerun(idempotent=True) to avoid re-running a workflow that is already in running or in a pending state. This will return details of the already running workflow if found, and by default, it is set to False . Workflows run asynchronously Remember that workflows run asynchronously. See the packages and workflows introduction for details on how you can check the status and wait until the workflow has been completed. Coming soon Requires multiple steps through the raw REST API Find the existing workflow. Send through the resulting re-run request. POST /api/service/workflows/indexsearch 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 { \"from\" : 0 , \"size\" : 5 , \"query\" : { \"bool\" : { \"filter\" : [ { \"nested\" : { \"path\" : \"metadata\" , \"query\" : { \"prefix\" : { \"metadata.name.keyword\" : { \"value\" : \"csa-asset-export-basic\" // (1) } } } } } ] } }, \"sort\" : [ { \"metadata.creationTimestamp\" : { \"nested\" : { \"path\" : \"metadata\" }, \"order\" : \"desc\" } } ], \"track_total_hits\" : true } Searching by the csa-asset-export-basic prefix will ensure you only find existing asset export basic workflows. Name of the workflow The name of the workflow will be nested within the _source.metadata.name property of the response object. (Remember since this is a search, there could be multiple results, so you may want to use the other details in each result to determine which workflow you really want.) POST /api/service/workflows/submit 100 101 102 103 104 { \"namespace\" : \"default\" , \"resourceKind\" : \"WorkflowTemplate\" , \"resourceName\" : \"csa-asset-export-basic-1684500411\" // (1) } Send the name of the workflow as the resourceName to rerun it. 2024-11-20 2025-01-28 Was this page helpful?

Atlan. Complete reference This is a complete reference for the QlikSpace object in Atlan, showing every possible property and relationship that can exist for these objects. For an introduction, you probably want to start with: Snippets — small, atomic examples of single-step use cases. Patterns — walkthroughs of common multi-step implementation patterns. QlikSpace inherits its attributes and relationships from these other types: classDiagram direction RL class QlikSpace link QlikSpace \"../qlikspace\" class Qlik { <<abstract>> } link Qlik \"../qlik\" Qlik <|-- QlikSpace : extends class BI { <<abstract>> } link BI \"../bi\" BI <|-- Qlik : extends class Catalog { <<abstract>> } link Catalog \"../catalog\" Catalog <|-- BI : extends class Asset { <<abstract>> } link Asset \"../asset\" Asset <|-- Catalog : extends class Referenceable { <<abstract>> } link Referenceable \"../referenceable\" Referenceable <|-- Asset : extends Properties ¶ Inherited properties These attributes are inherited from QlikSpace 's supertypes (shown above): typeName ¶ Type of this asset. guid ¶ Globally-unique identifier for this asset. classifications ¶ Tags assigned to the asset. (1) Uses a different name in SDKs atlanTags atlan_tags For more information, see the tag assets snippets. businessAttributes ¶ Map of custom metadata attributes and values defined on the asset. (1) Uses a different name in SDKs customMetadataSets custom_metadata For more information, see the change custom metadata snippets. status ¶ Status of the asset. (1) Treat as read-only You should not try to set status on an asset. Instead, see the asset CRUD snippets on deleting and restoring assets. createdBy ¶ User or account that created the asset. updatedBy ¶ User or account that last updated the asset. createTime ¶ Time (epoch) at which the asset was created, in milliseconds. updateTime ¶ Time (epoch) at which the asset was last updated, in milliseconds. deleteHandler ¶ Details on the handler used for deletion of the asset.

existing workflow Asset import package ¶ The asset import package loads metadata from a CSV file that matches the format of one extracted using either of the asset export packages ( basic or advanced ). Import assets from object store ¶ 2.6.0 To import assets directly from the object store: Java Python Kotlin Raw REST API Coming soon Import assets from the object store 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 from pyatlan.client.atlan import AtlanClient from pyatlan.model.packages import AssetImport from pyatlan.model.assets import Asset from pyatlan.model.enums import AssetInputHandling client = AtlanClient () workflow = ( AssetImport () # (1) . object_store () # (2) . s3 ( # (3) access_key = \"test-access-key\" , secret_key = \"test-secret-key\" , bucket = \"my-bucket\" , region = \"us-west-1\" , ) . assets ( # (4) prefix = \"/test/prefix\" , object_key = \"assets-test.csv\" , input_handling = AssetInputHandling .

Set up the package to import metadata directly from the object store. You can use different object store methods (e.g: s3() , gcs() , adls() ). In this example, we're building a workflow using s3() and for that, you’ll need to provide the following information: AWS access key. AWS secret key. name of the bucket/storage that contains the metadata CSV files. name of the AWS region. (Optional) To set up the package for importing assets, provide the following information: prefix : directory (path) within the object store from which to retrieve the file containing asset metadata. object_key : object key (filename), including its extension, within the object store and prefix input_handling : specifies whether to allow the creation of new assets from the input CSV with full ( AssetInputHandling.UPSERT ) or partial assets ( AssetInputHandling.PARTIAL ) or only update ( AssetInputHandling.UPDATE ) existing assets in Atlan. (Optional) To set up the package for importing assets with advanced configuration, provide the following information: remove_attributes : list of attributes to clear (remove) from assets if their value is blank in the provided file. fail_on_errors : specifies whether an invalid value in a field should cause the import to fail ( True ) or log a warning, skip that value, and proceed ( False ). case_sensitive_match : indicates whether to use case-sensitive matching when running in update-only mode ( True ) or to try case-insensitive matching ( False ). is_table_view_agnostic : specifies whether to treat tables, views, and materialized views as interchangeable ( True ) or to strictly adhere to specified types in the input ( False ). field_separator : character used to separate fields in the input file (e.g: ',' or ';' ). batch_size : maximum number of rows to process at a time (per API request). (Optional) To set up the package for importing glossaries, provide the following information: prefix : directory (path) within the object store from which to retrieve the file containing glossaries, categories and terms. object_key : object key (filename), including its extension, within the object store and prefix input_handling : specifies whether to allow the creation of new glossaries, categories and terms from the input CSV ( AssetInputHandling.UPSERT ) or or ensure these are only updated ( AssetInputHandling.UPDATE ) if they already exist in Atlan. (Optional) To set up the package for importing glossaries with advanced configuration, provide the following information: remove_attributes : list of attributes to clear (remove) from assets if their value is blank in the provided file. fail_on_errors : specifies whether an invalid value in a field should cause the import to fail ( True ) or log a warning, skip that value, and proceed ( False ). field_separator : character used to separate fields in the input file (e.g: ',' or ';' ). batch_size : maximum number of rows to process at a time (per API request). (Optional) To set up the package for importing data products, provide the following information: prefix : directory (path) within the object store from which to retrieve the file containing data domains, and data products. object_key : object key (filename), including its extension, within the object store and prefix input_handling : specifies whether to allow the creation of new data domains, and data products from the input CSV ( AssetInputHandling.UPSERT ) or or ensure these are only updated ( AssetInputHandling.UPDATE ) if they already exist in Atlan. (Optional) To set up the package for importing data domain and data products with advanced configuration, provide the following information: remove_attributes : list of attributes to clear (remove) from assets if their value is blank in the provided file. fail_on_errors : specifies whether an invalid value in a field should cause the import to fail ( True ) or log a warning, skip that value, and proceed ( False ). field_separator : character used to separate fields in the input file (e.g: ',' or ';' ). batch_size : maximum number of rows to process at a time (per API request). Convert the package into a Workflow object. Run the workflow by invoking the run() method on the workflow client, passing the created object. Workflows run asynchronously Remember that workflows run asynchronously. See the packages and workflows introduction for details on how to check the status and wait until the workflow has been completed. Coming soon Create the workflow via UI only We recommend creating the workflow only via the UI. To rerun an existing workflow, see the steps below. Re-run existing workflow ¶ 2.6.0 To re-run an existing asset import workflow: Java Python Kotlin Raw REST API Coming soon Re-run existing asset import workflow 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 from pyatlan.client.atlan import AtlanClient from pyatlan.model.enums import WorkflowPackage client = AtlanClient () existing = client . workflow . find_by_type ( # (1) prefix = WorkflowPackage . ASSET_IMPORT , max_results = 5 ) # Determine which asset import workflow (n) # from the list of results you want to re-run. response = client . workflow . rerun ( existing [ n ]) # (2) You can find workflows by their type using the workflow client find_by_type() method and providing the prefix for one of the packages. In this example, we do so for the AssetImport . (You can also specify the maximum number of resulting workflows you want to retrieve as results.) Once you've found the workflow you want to re-run, you can simply call the workflow client rerun() method. Optionally, you can use rerun(idempotent=True) to avoid re-running a workflow that is already in running or in a pending state. This will return details of the already running workflow if found, and by default, it is set to False . Workflows run asynchronously Remember that workflows run asynchronously. See the packages and workflows introduction for details on how you can check the status and wait until the workflow has been completed. Coming soon Requires multiple steps through the raw REST API Find the existing workflow. Send through the resulting re-run request. POST /api/service/workflows/indexsearch 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 { \"from\" : 0 , \"size\" : 5 , \"query\" : { \"bool\" : { \"filter\" : [ { \"nested\" : { \"path\" : \"metadata\" , \"query\" : { \"prefix\" : { \"metadata.name.keyword\" : { \"value\" : \"csa-asset-import\" // (1) } } } } } ] } }, \"sort\" : [ { \"metadata.creationTimestamp\" : { \"nested\" : { \"path\" : \"metadata\" }, \"order\" : \"desc\" } } ], \"track_total_hits\" : true } Searching by the csa-asset-import prefix will ensure you only find existing asset import workflows. Name of the workflow The name of the workflow will be nested within the _source.metadata.name property of the response object. (Remember since this is a search, there could be multiple results, so you may want to use the other details in each result to determine which workflow you really want.) POST /api/service/workflows/submit 100 101 102 103 104 { \"namespace\" : \"default\" , \"resourceKind\" : \"WorkflowTemplate\" , \"resourceName\" : \"csa-asset-import-1684500411\" // (1) } Send the name of the workflow as the resourceName to rerun it. 2024-11-20 2025-01-28 Was this page helpful?

Obtain the SDK Configure the SDK Using environment variables On client creation What's next? Error-handling Advanced configuration Logging Retries Timeouts Multi-tenant connectivity Proxies Asynchronous SDK operations Basic search example Concurrent operations for improved performance Python SDK ¶ Atlan University Walk through step-by-step in our intro to custom integration course (30 mins). Obtain the SDK ¶ The SDK is currently available on pypi . You can use pip to install it as follows: Install the SDK pip install pyatlan Configure the SDK ¶ There are two ways to configure the SDK: Using environment variables ¶ ATLAN_API_KEY should be given your Atlan API token , for authentication ( don't forget to assign one or more personas to the API token to give access to existing assets! ) ATLAN_BASE_URL should be given your Atlan URL (for example, https://tenant.atlan.com ) Here's an example of setting those environment variables: Set environment variables export ATLAN_BASE_URL=https://tenant.atlan.com export ATLAN_API_KEY=\"...\" atlan_live_test.py 1 2 3 from pyatlan.client.atlan import AtlanClient client = AtlanClient () On client creation ¶ If you prefer to not use environment variables, you can do the following: atlan_live_test.py 1 2 3 4 5 6 from pyatlan.client.atlan import AtlanClient client = AtlanClient ( base_url = \"https://tenant.atlan.com\" , api_key = \"...\" ) Careful not to expose your API token! We generally discourage including your API token directly in your code, in case you accidentally commit it into a (public) version control system. But it's your choice exactly how you manage the API token and including it for use within the client. (optional) Want to create a client using an API token GUID? In some scenarios, you may not want to expose the entire API token or manage environment variables. Instead, you can provide the GUID of the API token, and the SDK will internally fetch the actual access token. When to use this approach: Building apps that use the SDK where token security is a concern When you want to avoid exposing full API tokens in your configuration For containerized applications that need secure token management Prerequisites: Before using this approach, ensure your Argo template is configured with CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET : Argo template configuration 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 container : image : ghcr.io/atlanhq/designation-based-group-provisioning:1.0.2 imagePullPolicy : IfNotPresent env : - name : CLIENT_ID valueFrom : secretKeyRef : name : \"argo-client-creds\" key : \"login\" - name : CLIENT_SECRET valueFrom : secretKeyRef : name : \"argo-client-creds\" key : \"password\" Python 7.1.4 Creating a client with API token GUID 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 from pyatlan.client.atlan import AtlanClient from pyatlan.model.fluent_search import FluentSearch from pyatlan.model.query import CompoundQuery from pyatlan.model.assets import AtlasGlossary # Initialize client using API token GUID token_client = AtlanClient . from_token_guid ( guid = \"c5e249d7-abcc-4ad5-87a1-831d7b810df4\" # (1) ) # Perform operations with the client (requires appropriate permissions) results = ( FluentSearch () . where ( CompoundQuery . active_assets ()) . where ( CompoundQuery . asset_type ( AtlasGlossary )) . page_size ( 100 ) . execute ( client = token_client ) ) assert results and results . count >= 1 print ( f \"Found { results . count } glossary assets\" ) Create client from token GUID : Use AtlanClient.from_token_guid() to create a client using the GUID of an API token. The SDK will automatically fetch the actual access token using the configured CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET . That's it — once these are set you can start using your SDK to make live calls against your Atlan instance! 🎉 What's next? ¶ Delve into more detailed examples: Common tasks Common operations on assets, that are available across all assets.

Learn more about searching Events Delve deep into the details of the events Atlan triggers. Learn more about events Error-handling ¶ The SDK defines exceptions for the following categories of error: Exception Description ApiConnectionError Errors when the SDK is unable to connect to the API, for example due to a lack of network access or timeouts. AuthenticationError Errors when the API token configured for the SDK is invalid or expired. ConflictError Errors when there is some conflict with an existing asset and the operation cannot be completed as a result. InvalidRequestError Errors when the request sent to Atlan does not match its expectations. If you are using the built-in methods like toCreate() and toUpdate() this exception should be treated as a bug in the SDK. (These operations take responsibility for avoiding this error.) LogicError Errors where some assumption made in the SDK's code is proven incorrect. If ever raised, they should be reported as bugs against the SDK. NotFoundError Errors when the requested resource or asset does not exist in Atlan. PermissionError Errors when the API token used by the SDK does not have permission to access a resource or carry out an operation on a specific asset . RateLimitError Errors when the Atlan server is being overwhelmed by requests. A given API call could fail due to all of the errors above. So these all extend a generic AtlanError exception, and all API operations can potentially raise AtlanError . Example For example, when creating a connection there is an asynchronous process that grants permissions to the admins of that connection. So there can be a slight delay between creating the connection and being permitted to do any operations with the connection. During that delay, any attempt to interact with the connection will result in a PermissionError , even if your API token was used to create connection in the first place. Another example you may occasionally hit is some network issue that causes your connection to Atlan to be interrupted. In these cases, an ApiConnectionError will be raised. Don't worry, the SDK retries automatically While these are useful to know for detecting issues, the SDK automatically retries on such problems. Advanced configuration ¶ Atlan is a distributed, cloud-native application, where network problems can arise. The SDK therefore automatically attempts to handle ephemeral problems. Logging ¶ The SDK uses logging module of the standard library that can provide a flexible framework for emitting log messages. Python You can enable logging for your SDK script by adding the following lines above your snippets: atlan_python_sdk_test.py 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 import logging from pyatlan.client.atlan import AtlanClient from pyatlan.model.assets import AtlasGlossary logging . basicConfig ( level = logging . DEBUG ) # (1) # logging.config.fileConfig('pyatlan/logging.conf') # (2) # SDK code snippets client = AtlanClient () glossary = client . asset . get_by_guid ( asset_type = AtlasGlossary , guid = \"b4113341-251b-4adc-81fb-2420501c30e6\" ) You can enable logging by using basicConfig with various logging levels: logging.DEBUG : used to give detailed information, typically of interest only when diagnosing problems (mostly used level in SDK). logging.INFO : used to confirm that things are working as expected. logging.WARN : used as an indication that something unexpected happened, or as a warning of some problem in the near future. logging.ERROR : indicates that due to a more serious problem, the SDK has not been able to perform some operation. logging.CRITICAL : indicates a serious error, suggesting that the program itself may be unable to continue running (not used in SDK as of now). By default, logs will appear in your console. If you want to use file logging, you can add the following line: logging.config.fileConfig('pyatlan/logging.conf') : this will generate logs according to the configuration defined in pyatlan/logging.conf and will generate two log files: /tmp/pyatlan.log : default log file. /tmp/pyatlan.json : log file in JSON format. Retries ¶ The SDK handles automatically retrying your requests when it detects certain problems: When there is a 403 response indicating that permission for an operation is not (yet) available. When there is a 429 response indicating that the request rate limit has been exceeded, and you need to retry after some time. When there is a 50x response indicating that something went wrong on the server side. More details on how they work If any request encounters one of these problems, it will be retried. Before each retry, the SDK will apply a delay using an exponential backoff. (Currently the values for the exponential backoff are not configurable.) For each request that encounters any of these problems, only up to a maximum number of retries will be attempted. (This is set to 5 by default.) Timeouts ¶ By default, the SDK AtlanClient() has the following timeout settings: read_timeout : 900.0 seconds ( 15 minutes) connect_timeout : 30.0 seconds If you need to override these defaults, you can do so as shown in the example below: Override SDK client default timeout 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 from pyatlan.client.atlan import AtlanClient client = AtlanClient () # Timeout values in seconds client . read_timeout = 1800.0 # 30 minutes client . connect_timeout = 60.0 # 1 minute Multi-tenant connectivity ¶ Since version 1.0.0, the Python SDK supports connecting to multiple tenants.[^1] When you use the AtlanClient() method you are actually setting a default client. This default client will be used behind-the-scenes for any operations that need information specific to an Atlan tenant. When you want to override that default client you can create a new one and use the set_default_client() method to change it: Create a client 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 from pyatlan.client.atlan import AtlanClient client2 = AtlanClient ( # (1) base_url = \"https://tenant.atlan.com\" , api_key = \"...\" ) Atlan . set_default_client ( client2 ) # (2) The AtlanClient() method will return a client for the given base URL, creating a new client and setting this new client as the default client. If you want to switch between clients that you have already created, you can use Atlan.set_default_client() to change between them. Limit the number of clients to those you must have Each client you create maintains its own independent copy of various caches. So the more clients you have, the more resources your code will consume. For this reason, we recommended limiting the number of clients you create to the bare minimum you require — ideally just a single client per tenant. (And since in the majority of use cases you only need access to a single tenant, this means you can most likely just rely on the default client and the fallback behavior.) Proxies ¶ Pyatlan uses the Requests library which supports proxy configuration via environment variables. Requests relies on the proxy configuration defined by standard environment variables http_proxy, https_proxy, no_proxy, and all_proxy. Uppercase variants of these variables are also supported. You can therefore set them to configure Pyatlan (only set the ones relevant to your needs): Configure a proxy export HTTP_PROXY = \"http://10.10.1.10:3128\" export HTTPS_PROXY = \"http://10.10.1.10:1080\" export ALL_PROXY = \"socks5://10.10.1.10:3434\" To use HTTP Basic Auth with your proxy, use the http://user:password@host/ syntax in any of the above configuration entries: Configure a proxy with authentication export HTTPS_PROXY = \"http://user:pass@10.10.1.10:1080\" Currently, the way this is implemented limits you to either avoiding multiple threads in your Python code (if you need to use multiple clients), or if you want to use multiple threads you should only use a single client. Asynchronous SDK operations ¶ 8.0.0 Starting from version v8.0 , it's possible to run SDK code asynchronously. The async API is designed to mirror the synchronous SDK clients, maintaining familiar client patterns and caching behavior to ensure a smooth developer experience ( see release notes for complete changes ). To get started, you need to initialize an AsyncAtlanClient : Create an async client 1 2 3 4 5 6 from pyatlan.client.aio import AsyncAtlanClient client = AsyncAtlanClient ( # (1) base_url = \"https://tenant.atlan.com\" , api_key = \"...\" ) Create an async client using the same configuration pattern as the synchronous client. Basic search example ¶ This example demonstrates how to perform an asynchronous search for tables. The API is nearly identical to the synchronous version, with the addition of async/await keywords: Run an async search 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 import asyncio from pyatlan.client.aio import AsyncAtlanClient from pyatlan.model.fluent_search import FluentSearch from pyatlan.model.search import Term from pyatlan.model.assets import Asset client = AsyncAtlanClient ( base_url = \"https://tenant.atlan.com\" , api_key = \"...\" ) async def search_tables (): \"\"\"Search for all active tables\"\"\" results = await client . asset . search ( # (1) criteria = FluentSearch () . where ( Term . with_state ( \"ACTIVE\" )) . where ( Asset . TYPE_NAME . eq ( \"Table\" )) . to_request (), ) # Process results asynchronously async for table in results : # (2) print ( f \"Found table: { table . name } \" ) return results . count # Run the async function total_count = asyncio . run ( search_tables ()) print ( f \"Total tables found: { total_count } \" ) Async search : Build search requests using the same FluentSearch pattern as the synchronous client. Use await since the async client returns a coroutine object. Async iteration : Use async for to iterate through results, as the async client returns AsyncIndexSearchResults which implements __aiter__ . Concurrent operations for improved performance ¶ The real power of async comes from running multiple operations concurrently . Instead of waiting for each operation to complete sequentially, you can execute them in parallel and reduce total execution time: Performance comparison: Synchronous : Total time = operation₁ + operation₂ + ... + operationₙ Asynchronous : Total time = max(operation₁, operation₂, ..., operationₙ) Run concurrent async searches 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 import asyncio from pyatlan.client.aio import AsyncAtlanClient from pyatlan.model.fluent_search import FluentSearch from pyatlan.model.search import Term from pyatlan.model.assets import Asset client = AsyncAtlanClient ( base_url = \"https://tenant.atlan.com\" , api_key = \"...\" ) async def search_tables (): # (1) \"\"\"Search for all active tables\"\"\" results = await client . asset . search ( criteria = FluentSearch () . where ( Term . with_state ( \"ACTIVE\" )) . where ( Asset . TYPE_NAME . eq ( \"Table\" )) . to_request (), ) return results . count async def search_columns (): # (2) \"\"\"Search for all active columns\"\"\" results = await client . asset . search ( criteria = FluentSearch () . where ( Term . with_state ( \"ACTIVE\" )) . where ( Asset . TYPE_NAME . eq ( \"Column\" )) . to_request (), ) return results . count async def concurrent_search (): \"\"\"Run table and column searches concurrently\"\"\" # Execute both searches at the same time table_count , column_count = await asyncio . gather ( # (3) search_tables (), search_columns () ) return { \"tables\" : table_count , \"columns\" : column_count , \"total_assets\" : table_count + column_count } async def main (): \"\"\"Main function to execute concurrent asset searches\"\"\" return await concurrent_search () if __name__ == \"__main__\" : result = asyncio . run ( main ()) print ( f \"Search completed: { result [ 'total_assets' ] } assets found\" ) print ( f \"Tables: { result [ 'tables' ] } , Columns: { result [ 'columns' ] } \" ) Tables search function : Define an async function to search for tables and return the count. Columns search function : Define an async function to search for columns and return the count. Concurrent execution : Use asyncio.gather() to run both searches simultaneously. You can also use asyncio.as_completed() if you want to process results as they become available: tasks = [ search_tables (), search_columns ()] for coro in asyncio . as_completed ( tasks ): result = await coro print ( f \"Operation completed with { result } assets\" ) When to use async Async is most beneficial when you have: Multiple independent operations that can run concurrently I/O-heavy workloads like API calls, database queries, or file operations Long-running operations where parallelization provides significant time savings For simple, single operations, the synchronous client may be more straightforward to use. 2023-06-28 2025-08-20 Was this page helpful?

¶ Base class for Apache Airflow assets. Reference documentation This is reference documentation covering the entire Atlan model. It is not the best place to start when trying to understand developing with Atlan. For that, we would suggest starting with either: Snippets — small, atomic examples of single-step use cases. Patterns — walkthroughs of common multi-step implementation patterns. classDiagram direction RL class Airflow { <<abstract>> } link Airflow \"../airflow\" class Catalog { <<abstract>> } link Catalog \"../entities/catalog\" Catalog <|-- Airflow : extends class Asset { <<abstract>> } link Asset \"../entities/asset\" Asset <|-- Catalog : extends class Referenceable { <<abstract>> } link Referenceable \"../entities/referenceable\" Referenceable <|-- Asset : extends class AirflowDag link AirflowDag \"../entities/airflowdag\" Airflow <|-- AirflowDag : extends class AirflowTask link AirflowTask \"../entities/airflowtask\" Airflow <|-- AirflowTask : extends Properties ¶ These attributes are specific to instances of Airflow (and all of its subtypes). airflowRunEndTime ¶ End time of the run. airflowRunName ¶ Name of the run. airflowRunOpenLineageState ¶ State of the run in OpenLineage. airflowRunOpenLineageVersion ¶ Version of the run in OpenLineage. airflowRunStartTime ¶ Start time of the run. airflowRunType ¶ Type of the run. airflowRunVersion ¶ Version of the run in Airflow. airflowTags ¶ Tags assigned to the asset in Airflow.

/api/service/workflows/indexsearch (POST) /api/service/workflows/submit (POST) Sigma assets package ¶ The Sigma assets package crawls Sigma assets and publishes them to Atlan for discovery. Will create a new connection This should only be used to create the workflow the first time. Each time you run this method it will create a new connection and new assets within that connection — which could lead to duplicate assets if you run the workflow this way multiple times with the same settings. Instead, when you want to re-crawl assets, re-run the existing workflow (see Re-run existing workflow below). 7.0.0 4.0.0 To crawl assets directly from Sigma: Java Python Kotlin Raw REST API Direct extraction from Sigma 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 Workflow crawler = SigmaCrawler . creator ( // (1) client , // (2) \"production\" , // (3) List . of ( client . getRoleCache (). getIdForName ( \"$admin\" )), // (4) null , null , true , // (5) true , // (6) 10000L // (7) ) . direct ( // (8) \"aws-api.sigmacomputing.com\" , ) . apiToken ( \"client-id\" , // (9) \"api-token\" // (10) ) . include ( // (11) List . of ( \"995aecc2-fecf-497a-b169-5b3f96073618\" ) ) . exclude ( List . of ()) // (12) . build () // (13) . toWorkflow (); // (14) WorkflowResponse response = crawler . run ( client ); // (15) The SigmaCrawler package will create a workflow to crawl assets from Sigma. You must provide Atlan client. You must provide a name for the connection that the Sigma assets will exist within. You must specify at least one connection admin , either: everyone in a role (in this example, all $admin users). a list of groups (names) that will be connection admins. a list of users (names) that will be connection admins. You can specify whether you want to allow queries to this connection ( true , as in this example) or deny all query access to the connection ( false ). You can specify whether you want to allow data previews on this connection ( true , as in this example) or deny all sample data previews to the connection ( false ). You can specify a maximum number of rows that can be accessed for any asset in the connection. When crawling assets directly from Sigma, you are required to provide the following information: hostname of the Sigma host, for example aws-api.sigmacomputing.com You must provide client ID through which to access Sigma. You must provide API token through which to access Sigma. You can also optionally specify the list of workbooks to include in crawling. For Sigma assets, this should be specified as a list of workbook GUIDs. If set to null, all workbooks will be crawled. You can also optionally specify the list of workbooks to exclude from crawling. For Sigma assets, this should be specified as a list of workbook GUIDs. If set to null, no workbooks will be excluded. Build the minimal package object. Now, you can convert the package into a Workflow object. You can then run the workflow using the run() method on the object you've created. Because this operation will execute work in Atlan, you must provide it an AtlanClient through which to connect to the tenant. Workflows run asynchronously Remember that workflows run asynchronously. See the packages and workflows introduction for details on how you can check the status and wait until the workflow has been completed.

See the packages and workflows introduction for details on how you can check the status and wait until the workflow has been completed. Create the workflow via UI only We recommend creating the workflow only via the UI. To rerun an existing workflow, see the steps below. Re-run existing workflow ¶ 1.9.5 4.0.0 To re-run an existing workflow for Sigma assets: Java Python Kotlin Raw REST API Re-run existing Sigma workflow 1 2 3 4 5 6 List < WorkflowSearchResult > existing = WorkflowSearchRequest // (1) . findByType ( client , SigmaCrawler . PREFIX , 5 ); // (2) // Determine which of the results is the // Sigma workflow you want to re-run... WorkflowRunResponse response = existing . get ( n ). rerun ( client ); // (3) You can search for existing workflows through the WorkflowSearchRequest class. You can find workflows by their type using the findByType() helper method and providing the prefix for one of the packages. In this example, we do so for the SigmaCrawler . (You can also specify the maximum number of resulting workflows you want to retrieve as results.) Once you've found the workflow you want to re-run, you can simply call the rerun() helper method on the workflow search result. The WorkflowRunResponse is just a subtype of WorkflowResponse so has the same helper method to monitor progress of the workflow run. Because this operation will execute work in Atlan, you must provide it an AtlanClient through which to connect to the tenant. Optionally, you can use the rerun(client, true) method with idempotency to avoid re-running a workflow that is already in running or in a pending state. This will return details of the already running workflow if found, and by default, it is set to false Workflows run asynchronously Remember that workflows run asynchronously. See the packages and workflows introduction for details on how you can check the status and wait until the workflow has been completed. Re-run existing Sigma workflow 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 from pyatlan.client.atlan import AtlanClient from pyatlan.model.enums import WorkflowPackage client = AtlanClient () existing = client . workflow . find_by_type ( # (1) prefix = WorkflowPackage . Sigma , max_results = 5 ) # Determine which Sigma workflow (n) # from the list of results you want to re-run. response = client . workflow . rerun ( existing [ n ]) # (2) You can find workflows by their type using the workflow client find_by_type() method and providing the prefix for one of the packages. In this example, we do so for the SigmaCrawler . (You can also specify the maximum number of resulting workflows you want to retrieve as results.) Once you've found the workflow you want to re-run, you can simply call the workflow client rerun() method. Optionally, you can use rerun(idempotent=True) to avoid re-running a workflow that is already in running or in a pending state. This will return details of the already running workflow if found, and by default, it is set to False . Workflows run asynchronously Remember that workflows run asynchronously. See the packages and workflows introduction for details on how you can check the status and wait until the workflow has been completed. Re-run existing Sigma workflow 1 2 3 4 5 6 val existing = WorkflowSearchRequest // (1) . findByType ( client , SigmaCrawler .

See the packages and workflows introduction for details on how you can check the status and wait until the workflow has been completed. Requires multiple steps through the raw REST API Find the existing workflow. Send through the resulting re-run request. POST /api/service/workflows/indexsearch 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 { \"from\" : 0 , \"size\" : 5 , \"query\" : { \"bool\" : { \"filter\" : [ { \"nested\" : { \"path\" : \"metadata\" , \"query\" : { \"prefix\" : { \"metadata.name.keyword\" : { \"value\" : \"atlan-sigma\" // (1) } } } } } ] } }, \"sort\" : [ { \"metadata.creationTimestamp\" : { \"nested\" : { \"path\" : \"metadata\" }, \"order\" : \"desc\" } } ], \"track_total_hits\" : true } Searching by the atlan-sigma prefix will ensure you only find existing Sigma assets workflows. Name of the workflow The name of the workflow will be nested within the _source.metadata.name property of the response object. (Remember since this is a search, there could be multiple results, so you may want to use the other details in each result to determine which workflow you really want.) POST /api/service/workflows/submit 100 101 102 103 104 { \"namespace\" : \"default\" , \"resourceKind\" : \"WorkflowTemplate\" , \"resourceName\" : \"atlan-sigma-1684500411\" // (1) } Send the name of the workflow as the resourceName to rerun it. 2023-12-29 2025-06-11 Was this page helpful?

Properties isGlobal link reference resourceMetadata Relationships Resources model ¶ These are the model elements in Atlan related to resources — covering things like links and files. Reference documentation This is reference documentation covering the entire Atlan model. It is not the best place to start when trying to understand how to manage resources in Atlan. For that, we would suggest starting with either: the add asset resources / links snippets the manage file assets pattern classDiagram direction RL class Resource { <<abstract>> } link Resource \"../resource\" class Catalog { <<abstract>> } link Catalog \"../entities/catalog\" Catalog <|-- Resource : extends class Asset { <<abstract>> } link Asset \"../entities/asset\" Asset <|-- Catalog : extends class Referenceable { <<abstract>> } link Referenceable \"../entities/referenceable\" Referenceable <|-- Asset : extends class ReadmeTemplate link ReadmeTemplate \"../entities/readmetemplate\" Resource <|-- ReadmeTemplate : extends class Readme link Readme \"../entities/readme\" Resource <|-- Readme : extends class File link File \"../entities/file\" Resource <|-- File : extends class Link link Link \"../entities/link\" Resource <|-- Link : extends class Badge link Badge \"../entities/badge\" Asset <|-- Badge : extends Properties ¶ These attributes are specific to instances of Resource (and all of its subtypes). isGlobal ¶ Whether the resource is global (true) or not (false). link ¶ URL to the resource. reference ¶ Reference to the resource. resourceMetadata ¶ Metadata of the resource.

Complete reference This is a complete reference for the TableauWorksheet object in Atlan, showing every possible property and relationship that can exist for these objects. For an introduction, you probably want to start with: Snippets — small, atomic examples of single-step use cases. Patterns — walkthroughs of common multi-step implementation patterns. TableauWorksheet inherits its attributes and relationships from these other types: classDiagram direction RL class TableauWorksheet link TableauWorksheet \"../tableauworksheet\" class Tableau { <<abstract>> } link Tableau \"../tableau\" Tableau <|-- TableauWorksheet : extends class BI { <<abstract>> } link BI \"../bi\" BI <|-- Tableau : extends class Catalog { <<abstract>> } link Catalog \"../catalog\" Catalog <|-- BI : extends class Asset { <<abstract>> } link Asset \"../asset\" Asset <|-- Catalog : extends class Referenceable { <<abstract>> } link Referenceable \"../referenceable\" Referenceable <|-- Asset : extends Properties ¶ Inherited properties These attributes are inherited from TableauWorksheet 's supertypes (shown above): typeName ¶ Type of this asset. guid ¶ Globally-unique identifier for this asset. classifications ¶ Tags assigned to the asset. (1) Uses a different name in SDKs atlanTags atlan_tags For more information, see the tag assets snippets. businessAttributes ¶ Map of custom metadata attributes and values defined on the asset. (1) Uses a different name in SDKs customMetadataSets custom_metadata For more information, see the change custom metadata snippets. status ¶ Status of the asset. (1) Treat as read-only You should not try to set status on an asset. Instead, see the asset CRUD snippets on deleting and restoring assets. createdBy ¶ User or account that created the asset. updatedBy ¶ User or account that last updated the asset. createTime ¶ Time (epoch) at which the asset was created, in milliseconds. updateTime ¶ Time (epoch) at which the asset was last updated, in milliseconds. deleteHandler ¶ Details on the handler used for deletion of the asset. (1) Treat as read-only You should not try to set deleteHandler on an asset. Instead, see the asset CRUD snippets on deleting assets. classificationNames ¶ Hashed-string names of the Atlan tags that exist on the asset. (1) Uses a different name in SDKs atlanTagNames atlan_tag_names Use classifications to make changes to tags. isIncomplete ¶ Unused. meaningNames ¶ Human-readable names of terms that have been linked to this asset. meanings ¶ Details of terms that have been linked to this asset. (1) Do not use These should not be used, as they can be inconsistent. Instead, see the link terms and assets snippets. pendingTasks ¶ Unique identifiers (GUIDs) for any background tasks that are yet to operate on this asset. qualifiedName ¶ Unique name for this asset. This is typically a concatenation of the asset's name onto its parent's qualifiedName. This must be unique across all assets of the same type. adminGroups ¶ List of groups who administer this asset. (This is only used for certain asset types.) adminRoles ¶ List of roles who administer this asset. (This is only used for Connection assets.) adminUsers ¶ List of users who administer this asset. (This is only used for certain asset types.) announcementMessage ¶ Detailed message to include in the announcement on this asset. announcementTitle ¶ Brief title for the announcement on this asset. Required when announcementType is specified. announcementType ¶ Type of announcement on this asset. announcementUpdatedAt ¶ Time (epoch) at which the announcement was last updated, in milliseconds. announcementUpdatedBy ¶ Name of the user who last updated the announcement. applicationFieldQualifiedName ¶ Qualified name of the ApplicationField that contains this asset. applicationQualifiedName ¶ Qualified name of the Application that contains this asset. assetAnomaloAppliedCheckTypes ¶ All associated Anomalo check types. assetAnomaloCheckCount ¶ Total number of checks present in Anomalo for

ThoughtspotWorksheet Endpoints Table of contents Delete a group Delete a user /api/service/groups/{guid}/delete (POST) Deleting users and groups ¶ Deleting users and groups uses a similar pattern to the retrieval operations. For this you can use static methods provided by the AtlanUser and AtlanGroup classes. All delete operations are permanent All delete operations on users and groups are permanent, hard-deletes. There is no way to archive (soft-delete) users and groups. Delete a group ¶ 0.0.13 1.3.3 4.0.0 For example, to delete a group: Java Python Kotlin Go Raw REST API Delete a group 1 AtlanGroup . delete ( client , \"e79cb8eb-2bb6-4821-914c-f8dfd21fedc7\" ); // (1) To delete a group, you must specify its GUID and can simply call the AtlanGroup.delete() method. Because this operation will remove the group from Atlan, you must provide it an AtlanClient through which to connect to the tenant. Delete a group 1 2 3 4 from pyatlan.client.atlan import AtlanClient client = AtlanClient () client . group . purge ( \"e79cb8eb-2bb6-4821-914c-f8dfd21fedc7\" ) # (1) To delete a group, you must specify its GUID and can simply call the group.purge() method. Delete a group 1 AtlanGroup . delete ( client , \"e79cb8eb-2bb6-4821-914c-f8dfd21fedc7\" ) // (1) To delete a group, you must specify its GUID and can simply call the AtlanGroup.delete() method. Because this operation will remove the group from Atlan, you must provide it an AtlanClient through which to connect to the tenant. Delete a group 1 ctx . GroupClient . Purge ( \"a99f50bc-46bf-4d08-a987-3411ef5cfc33\" ) // (1) To delete a group, you must specify its GUID and can simply call the GroupClient.Purge() method. POST /api/service/groups/e79cb8eb-2bb6-4821-914c-f8dfd21fedc7/delete 1 // (1) All details are in the URL itself. Group ID in the URL Note that you must provide the unique ID (GUID) of the group to delete it. Delete a user ¶ 0.0.16 Irreversible operation that requires admin user's bearer token Deleting a user is irreversible — be certain you want to fully remove the user and all references to the user (their ownership of assets, workflows, and so on) before running this operation. This operation can only be done using an admin user's bearer token, not an API token. Go Delete a user 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 response , atlanErr := ctx . UserClient . RemoveUser ( \"test-user-1\" , \"test-user-2\" , \"test-user-3\" , ) // (1) if atlanErr != nil { logger . Log . Errorf ( \"Error deleting user: %v\" , atlanErr ) // (2) } Call the ctx.UserClient.RemoveUser() method with the following parameters : userName : The username of the user to be removed ( \"test-user-1\" in this example). transferToUserName : The username of the user to whom the assets should be transferred ( \"test-user-2\" in this example). wfCreatorUserName (optional) : The username of the workflow creator ( \"test-user-3\" in this example). If nil , it defaults to transferToUserName . If an error occurs during the deletion, it will be logged. Note: A user can only be removed if they have fewer permissions than an admin. An admin cannot remove another admin. 2022-12-28 2025-02-25 Was this page helpful? Thanks for your feedback! Thanks for your feedback!

Writing tests for non-toolkit based scripts Step 1: Rename directory to snake_case Step 2: Refactor main.py Step 3: Add integration tests Recommended testing strategy for scripts Writing tests for non-toolkit based scripts using Cursor AI code editor Step 1: Setup Cursor rules Step 2: Running the agent with the defined Rules Mocking / Patching third party HTTP interactions When do you need this? The problem with real API calls in tests The solution: VCR (Video Cassette Recorder) How VCR works Write VCR-based integration tests Containerizing marketplace scripts Overview Prerequisites Required files for containerization Development workflow Production release workflow Best practices for containerized scripts Testing toolkit ¶ With the testing toolkit we can guide you to write robust, reusable integration tests for connectors and utilities in Atlan. Writing tests for non-toolkit based scripts ¶ You can write integration tests for existing scripts in the marketplace-csa-scripts repository, even if they are not based on package toolkits. These tests help verify script behavior end-to-end in a real Atlan tenant. We'll begin by performing minimal refactoring of the existing script, as it's necessary to enable writing integration tests. Step 1: Rename directory to snake_case ¶ If the script is in kebab-case directory, convert it to snake_case . Do this just after renaming Update references in mkdocs.yml , delete the old directory, and verify imports/links still work. For example: Before: scripts/ └── designation-based-group-provisioning/ ├── main.py ├── index.md └── tests/ └── test_main.py After: scripts/ └── designation_based_group_provisioning/ ├── main.py ├── index.md └── tests/ └── test_main.py Step 2: Refactor main.py ¶ DO Refactor the script without altering logic or flow. Wrap all logic inside functions. Create a single entry point: main(args: argparse.Namespace) Call helper functions from main() — each should receive only required args or inputs . DO NOT Rename or restructure existing functions. Change the sequence or logic flow. Modify argument parsing. Add/remove logging unless required for debugging. Example refactored main.py : main.py 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 import argparse from typing import Any from pyatlan.client.atlan import AtlanClient from pyatlan.pkg.utils import get_client , set_package_s def load_input_file ( file_path : str ) -> Any : \"\"\"Load and validate the input file.\"\"\" # Your file loading logic here pass def process_data_with_atlan ( client : AtlanClient , data : Any ) -> None : \"\"\"Process the loaded data using Atlan client.\"\"\" # Your data processing logic here pass def main ( args : argparse . Namespace ) -> None : \"\"\"Main entry point for the script.\"\"\" # Initialize Atlan client client = get_client ( impersonate_user_id = args . user_id ) client = set_package_s ( client ) # Load and process data data = load_input_file ( args . input_file ) process_data_with_atlan ( client , data ) if __name__ == \"__main__\" : parser = argparse . ArgumentParser ( description = \"Script description\" ) parser . add_argument ( \"--user-id\" , required = True , help = \"User ID for impersonation\" ) parser . add_argument ( \"--input-file\" , required = True , help = \"Path to input file\" ) args = parser . parse_args () main ( args ) Step 3: Add integration tests ¶ Prerequisites: Install test dependencies ¶ Before writing tests, you need to install the required testing dependencies. Choose one of the following methods: Option 1: Install from package (recommended if available) pip install -e \".[test]\" Option 2: Install explicitly with requirements file Create a requirements-test.txt file: requirements-test.txt 1 2 3 4 5 6 pytest >= 7.4.0 coverage >= 7.6.1 # pytest plugins (optional but recommended) pytest - order >= 1.3.0 pytest - sugar >= 1.0.0 pytest - timer [ termcolor ] >= 1.0.0 Install the dependencies: pip install -r requirements-test.txt Ready to proceed Once dependencies are installed, you can proceed to write your integration tests. Test layout for test_main.py ¶ Create a tests/ folder if not already present: scripts/ └── my_script/ ├── main.py └── tests/ └── test_main.py Function Purpose test_main_functions Test small pure helper functions individually (useful for quick validation of logic) test_main Run the main() function with a config to simulate full script execution (end-to-end) test_after_main (optional) Validate side effects after running the script, such as asset creation, retrieval, audit logs, etc. Example Reference: For a complete real-world example, see the integration test for designation_based_group_provisioning/main.py . Recommended testing strategy for scripts ¶ When writing integration tests for scripts in marketplace-csa-scripts , follow these practices to ensure reliable and production-relevant test coverage: Best practices ¶ ✅ DO: Test against real Atlan tenants - Integration tests should interact with actual Atlan instances to validate real behavior Use environment variables for all secrets and configuration values Load configuration safely via .env files, CI/CD secrets, or shell configs — never hardcode sensitive data 🔄 MOCK ONLY WHEN NECESSARY: Use mocking or patching sparingly, and only for: External/third-party API calls (non-Atlan services) Database interactions not managed by Atlan Non-deterministic behavior (e.g., random data, time-based logic) ❌ AVOID: Mocking pyatlan clients or any Atlan interactions unless absolutely necessary Common pitfalls to avoid ¶ ❌ Don't hardcode sensitive values Never hardcode API keys, user-specific secrets, or test asset names Instead: Use environment variables and pyatlan.test_utils.TestId.make_unique() for unique naming Best practice: Generate test objects in fixtures for reusability and proper cleanup ❌ Don't use fake data Avoid placeholder data that doesn't reflect real Atlan entity structures Instead: Use data that closely mirrors production for meaningful tests ❌ Don't mock Atlan client methods Integration tests must execute real operations against live Atlan tenants Why: Mocking undermines the purpose of integration testing and may miss regressions Remember: You're testing the integration, not the individual components Full example (expand for details) test_main.py 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 125 import pytest from types import SimpleNamespace from pyatlan.pkg.utils import get_client , set_package_s import pandas as pd from scripts.designation_based_group_provisioning.main import ( review_groups , get_default_groups , get_ungrouped_users , map_users_by_designation , main , ) from pyatlan.model.group import AtlanGroup , CreateGroupResponse from pyatlan.client.atlan import AtlanClient from pyatlan.test_utils import TestId from typing import Generator import os from pathlib import Path TEST_PATH = Path ( __file__ ) . parent TEST_GROUP_NAME = TestId . make_unique ( \"csa-dbgp-test\" ) @pytest . fixture ( scope = \"module\" ) def config () -> SimpleNamespace : return SimpleNamespace ( user_id = os . environ . get ( \"ATLAN_USER_ID\" ), mapping_file = f \" { TEST_PATH } /test_mapping.csv\" , missing_groups_handler = \"SKIP\" , remove_from_default_group = \"\" , domain_name = \"mock-tenant.atlan.com\" , ) @pytest . fixture ( scope = \"module\" ) def client ( config ): if config . user_id : client = get_client ( impersonate_user_id = config . user_id ) else : client = AtlanClient () client = set_package_s ( client ) return client @pytest . fixture ( scope = \"module\" ) def group ( client : AtlanClient ) -> Generator [ CreateGroupResponse , None , None ]: to_create = AtlanGroup . create ( TEST_GROUP_NAME ) g = client . group . create ( group = to_create ) # Read the CSV file df = pd . read_csv ( f \" { TEST_PATH } /mapping.csv\" ) # Replace values in the 'GROUP_NAME' column with the test group name df [ \"GROUP_NAME\" ] = df [ \"GROUP_NAME\" ] . replace ( \"Data Engineers and Scientists\" , TEST_GROUP_NAME ) # Save the updated test CSV df . to_csv ( f \" { TEST_PATH } /test_mapping.csv\" , index = False ) assert os . path . exists ( f \" { TEST_PATH } /test_mapping.csv\" ) yield g client . group . purge ( g . group ) os . remove ( f \" { TEST_PATH } /test_mapping.csv\" ) def test_main_functions ( config : SimpleNamespace , client : AtlanClient , group : AtlanGroup , caplog : pytest .

However, it's important to be aware of the potential issues and risks that may arise. Step 1: Setup Cursor rules ¶ To ensure the AI agent provides the desired results based on your prompts, you need to set up custom rules for your code editor. Create a rules file: Create the file .cursor/rules/csa-scripts-tests.mdc in your project directory. You can start by copying the example rule and modifying them to match your needs. Refine rules over time: As you use AI for refactoring and generating tests, you can refine the rules. By adding more context (e.g: multiple packages and varied test patterns), the AI will become more effective over time, improving its results. Step 2: Running the agent with the defined Rules ¶ To run the AI agent with the defined rules, follow these steps: Open the cursor chat: Press cmd + L to open a new chat in the Cursor IDE. Click on Add Context , then select csa-scripts-tests.mdc to load the rules you defined. Provide a clear prompt: After loading the rules, provide a clear prompt like the following to refactor your script and add integration tests: Refactor `scripts/asset-change-notification/main.py` using the latest Cursor rules and add integration tests in `scripts/asset_change_notification/tests/test_main.py` to ensure functionality and coverage. Review results: Once the AI completes the task, review the generated results carefully. You may need to accept or reject parts of the refactoring based on your preferences and quality standards. Common Issues ¶ Low accuracy across models: AI results can be highly inconsistent, even after experimenting with different combinations of rules and prompts. In many cases, only a small fraction of attempts yield satisfactory results. Inconsistent output: Regardless of using detailed or minimal rules, and trying various AI models ( Claude 3.7, Sonnet 3.5, Gemini, OpenAI ), the output often lacks consistency, leading to unsatisfactory refactorings. Risks in refactoring ¶ Code deletion: AI can unintentionally remove important parts of the original code during refactoring. Unnecessary code addition: AI might add code that changes the behavior of the script, potentially introducing bugs. Flaky or insufficient tests: Generated tests are often overly simplistic or unreliable. AI may also mock components that should not be mocked, leading to incomplete test coverage. Mocking / Patching third party HTTP interactions ¶ When do you need this? ¶ This approach is essential when building connectors or utility packages that interact with external systems, such as: Fetching data from third-party APIs Integrating with external databases Calling web services that require authentication The problem with real API calls in tests ¶ ❌ Challenges with direct API testing: - Requires credentials and environment configurations - Difficult to integrate into automated test suites - Slow execution times, especially in CI/CD pipelines - Hard to maintain as more integrations are added - External service availability can break tests The solution: VCR (Video Cassette Recorder) ¶ ✅ Benefits of using VCR: - Record real API interactions once during development - Replay saved responses in tests without network calls - Fast, reliable, and reproducible tests - Works offline and in CI environments The vcrpy library captures and saves HTTP interactions in files called \"cassettes\" during development. How VCR works ¶ The workflow: Record → Run tests once with real API calls to record interactions Save → Store responses in local \"cassette\" files ( YAML or JSON ) Replay → Future test runs use saved responses instead of real HTTP requests Customize → Optionally modify saved responses to simulate different scenarios The benefits: 🚀 Faster tests - No network latency 🔒 Reliable - No dependency on external service availability 🔄 Reproducible - Same responses every time 🛠️ Configurable - Easy to simulate edge cases and error conditions Hybrid approach VCR sits between integration and unit tests — it uses real API behavior but avoids needing a live environment every time. This makes tests easier to maintain, faster to run, and more configurable as your project grows. Write VCR-based integration tests ¶ 6.0.6 For this example, we are using httpbin.org , which provides a simple and fast way to test vcrpy by recording HTTP request and response interactions. Have you installed test dependencies? Before writing tests, make sure you've installed the test dependencies in your local environment. You can do that by running the following command: pip install -e \".[test]\" Alternatively, you can explicitly install the required packages by creating a requirements-test.txt file and installing them using: requirements-test.txt 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 pytest>=7.4.0 coverage>=7.6.1 # pytest plugins (optional but recommended) pytest-order>=1.3.0 pytest-sugar>=1.0.0 pytest-timer[termcolor]>=1.0.0 pytest-vcr~=1.0.2 # pinned vcrpy to v6.x since vcrpy>=7.0 requires urllib3>=2.0 # which breaks compatibility with Python 3.8 vcrpy~=6.0.2 python tests/integration/test_http_bin.py 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 import pytest import requests import os from pyatlan.test_utils.base_vcr import BaseVCR # (1) class TestHTTPBin ( BaseVCR ): \"\"\" Integration tests to demonstrate VCR.py capabilities by recording and replaying HTTP interactions using HTTPBin (https://httpbin.org) for GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests. \"\"\" BASE_URL = \"https://httpbin.org\" @pytest . fixture ( scope = \"module\" ) # (2) def vcr_config ( self ): \"\"\" Override the VCR configuration to use JSON serialization across the module. \"\"\" config = self . _BASE_CONFIG . copy () config . update ({ \"serializer\" : \"pretty-json\" }) return config @pytest . fixture ( scope = \"module\" ) def vcr_cassette_dir ( self , request ): # (3) \"\"\" Override the directory path for storing VCR cassettes.

(Optional) To override any default vcr_config() , you can redefine the @pytest.fixture -> vcr_config() inside your test class. For example, you can update the serializer to use the custom pretty-json serializer. (Optional) To override the default cassette directory path , you can redefine the @pytest.fixture -> vcr_cassette_dir() inside your test class. When writing tests (e.g test_my_scenario ), make sure to add the @pytest.mark.vcr() decorator to mark them as VCR test cases. For each test case, a separate cassette (HTTP recording) will created inside the tests/vcr_cassettes/ directory. Once you run all the tests using: pytest tests/integration/test_http_bin.py Since this is the first time running them, vcrpy will record all the HTTP interactions automatically and save them into the tests/vcr_cassettes/ directory For example, here's a saved cassette for the TestHTTPBin.test_httpbin_post test: tests/vcr_cassettes/tests.integration.test_http_bin/TestHTTPBin.test_httpbin_post.yaml 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 interactions : - request : body : |- { \"name\": \"atlan\", \"type\": \"integration-test\" } s : {} method : POST uri : https://httpbin.org/post response : body : string : |- { \"args\": {}, \"data\": \"{\\\"name\\\": \\\"atlan\\\", \\\"type\\\": \\\"integration-test\\\"}\", \"files\": {}, \"form\": {}, \"s\": { \"Accept\": \"*/*\", \"Accept-Encoding\": \"gzip, deflate\", \"Content-Length\": \"45\", \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\", \"Host\": \"httpbin.org\", \"User-Agent\": \"python-requests/2.32.3\", \"X-Amzn-Trace-Id\": \"Root=1-680f7290-276efa7f015f83d24d9fdfc4\" }, \"json\": { \"name\": \"atlan\", \"type\": \"integration-test\" }, \"origin\": \"x.x.x.x\", \"url\": \"https://httpbin.org/post\" } s : {} status : code : 200 message : OK version : 1 vcrpy not sufficient for your use case? There might be cases where VCR.py's recorded responses are not sufficient for your testing needs, even after applying custom configurations. In such scenarios, you can switch to using Python's built-in mock/patch object library for greater flexibility and control over external dependencies. Containerizing marketplace scripts ¶ Overview ¶ When your script is ready for production deployment, you'll need to create package-specific Docker images for reliable and consistent execution across different environments. Why containerize? - ✅ Consistent execution across all environments - ✅ Proper versioning and rollback capability - ✅ Isolated dependencies prevent conflicts - ✅ Automated deployment via CI/CD pipelines Prerequisites ¶ Complete these steps first Before containerizing your script, ensure you have: ✅ Completed script refactoring from the Writing tests for non-toolkit based scripts section ✅ Working integration tests that validate your script functionality ✅ Script directory renamed to snake_case format (if applicable) Required files for containerization ¶ File checklist For each package script (e.g scripts/designation_based_group_provisioning/ ), you need to create 5 essential files : 📝 version.txt - Semantic versioning 🐳 Dockerfile - Container image definition 📦 requirements.txt - Package dependencies 🧪 requirements-test.txt - Testing dependencies 🔒 Vulnerability scan (using snyk CLI) Let's create each file step by step: 1. version.txt - semantic versioning ¶ Create a version file to track your package releases: version.txt 1 1.0.0dev Semantic versioning guidelines You should use .dev suffix for development Follow semantic versioning principles: MAJOR version: incompatible API changes MINOR version: backwards-compatible functionality additions PATCH version: backwards-compatible bug fixes 2. Dockerfile - package-specific image ¶ Create a production-ready Docker image for your script: Dockerfile 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 # Use the latest pyatlan-wolfi-base image FROM ghcr.io/atlanhq/pyatlan-wolfi-base:8.0.1-3.13 # Build arguments ARG PKG_DIR ARG APP_DIR = /app/designation_based_group_provisioning # Container metadata LABEL org.opencontainers.image.vendor = \"Atlan Pte. Ltd.\" \\ org.opencontainers.image.source = \"https://github.com/atlanhq/marketplace-csa-scripts\" \\ org.opencontainers.image.description = \"Atlan image for designation_based_group_provisioning custom package.\" \\ org.opencontainers.image.licenses = \"Apache-2.0\" # Switch to root for package installation USER root # Copy and install package requirements COPY ${ PKG_DIR } /requirements.txt requirements.txt # Install additional requirements system-wide with caching RUN --mount = type = cache,target = /root/.cache/uv \\ uv pip install --system -r requirements.txt && \\ rm requirements.txt # Copy application code and utilities COPY ${ PKG_DIR } ${ APP_DIR } / COPY utils /app/scripts/utils/ # Switch back to nonroot user for security USER nonroot # Set working directory WORKDIR /app About pyatlan-wolfi-base Use pyatlan-wolfi-base images for package scripts. The image is built on top of Chainguard Wolfi image with pyatlan . We use it because it is a vulnerability-free open source image and this image will auto-publish to ghcr on every pyatlan release (see image tag contains suffix e.g: 8.0.1-3.13 -> pyatlan_version-python-version ). If you want to use a custom pyatlan-wolfi-base for development (with different pyatlan version , pyatlan branch or python version ) you can also do this by manually triggering the GH workflow . Following are the inputs for that workflow: Navigate to Build Pyatlan Wolfi Base Image workflow Click \"Run workflow\" and provide the following inputs: Input Description Example Required Branch Use workflow from main ✅ Build type Build type ( dev uses amd64 only, release uses amd64+arm64 ) dev ✅ Python version Python version (leave empty for 3.13 ) 3.11 ❌ Pyatlan version Published pyatlan version (pull from PyPI, (leave empty to use version.txt ie: latest ) 7.2.0 ❌ Pyatlan git branch Pyatlan git branch (overrides version - installs from git://github.com/atlanhq/atlan-python.git@branch ) APP-1234 ❌ 3. requirements.txt - package dependencies ¶ Generate your package dependencies using pipreqs and include required OTEL logging dependencies: requirements.txt 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 # Package-specific dependencies # Generated via: pipreqs /path/to/pkg --force pyatlan>=8.0.0 pandas>=2.0.0 # Add your specific dependencies here... # Required for OpenTelemetry logging opentelemetry-api~=1.29.0 opentelemetry-sdk~=1.29.0 opentelemetry-instrumentation-logging~=0.50b0 opentelemetry-exporter-otlp~=1.29.0 Generating requirements automatically Use pipreqs to automatically detect and generate your package dependencies: ```bash # Install pipreqs if not already installed pip install pipreqs # Generate requirements for your package pipreqs /path/to/your/package --force # Example for a specific script pipreqs scripts/designation_based_group_provisioning --force ``` 4. requirements-test.txt - testing dependencies ¶ Create testing-specific dependencies for CI/CD and local development: requirements-test.txt 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 # Minimal required for testing coverage~=7.6.1 pytest>=7.4.0 pytest-order~=1.3.0 pytest-timer[termcolor]~=1.0.0 pytest-sugar~=1.0.0 # Add VCR support if using HTTP mocking pytest-vcr~=1.0.2 vcrpy~=6.0.2 5. Run snyk vulnerability scan: ¶ We also recommend running a snyk vulnerability scan on your requirements so that any issues can be fixed before doing a GA release. Step-by-step security scanning: Authenticate with Snyk CLI: snyk auth Follow the prompts to login via SSO and grant app access Scan project dependencies: # Ensure your virtual environment is active and dependencies are installed snyk test Scan Docker image (optional): # After building your Docker image locally snyk container test ghcr.io/atlanhq/designation_based_group_provisioning:1.0.0dev-0d35a91 --file = Dockerfile Create exceptions policy (if needed): If there are vulnerabilities that don't impact your project, create a .snyk policy file : # designation_based_group_provisioning/.snyk # Snyk (https://snyk.io) policy file, patches or ignores known issues. version : v1.0.0 # ignores vulnerabilities until expiry date; change duration by modifying expiry date ignore : 'snyk:lic:pip:certifi:MPL-2.0' : - '*' : reason : 'MPL-2.0 license is acceptable for this project - certifi is a widely used certificate bundle' Development workflow ¶ Testing your containerized package ¶ Use the Build Package Test Image workflow for rapid development and testing: Steps: Navigate to the workflow: Go to Build Package Test Image Trigger the build: Click \"Run workflow\" and provide the required inputs: Input Description Example Required Branch Select your development branch from dropdown APP-001-containerize-dbgp ✅ Package Directory Name of the package directory designation_based_group_provisioning ✅ Package Name Image name (defaults to kebab-case of directory) designation-based-group-provisioning ❌ Version Tag Custom version tag (defaults to version.txt-GITHASH) 1.0.0-dev ❌ The workflow will build a dev image with tag format: ghcr.io/atlanhq/designation-based-group-provisioning:1.0.0-dev-8799072 Benefits of development testing 🚀 Rapid iteration - Test containerized changes without affecting production 🔄 Environment consistency - Same container environment as production ✅ Integration validation - Verify your script works in containerized context Production release workflow ¶ Step 1: Prepare for GA release ¶ Before creating your pull request: Update version.txt : Ensure the version reflects your changes (final GA version) version.txt 1.0.0 Update HISTORY.md : Document all changes in this release HISTORY.md 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 ## 1.0.0 (July 1, 2025) ### Features ... ### Bug Fixes ... ### Breaking Changes ... ### QOL Improvements - Migrated package to build specific docker image. Verify integration tests : Ensure all tests pass locally pytest tests/ -s OR run tests with coverage: coverage run -m pytest tests && coverage report Step 2: Create pull request ¶ Create PR with your containerization changes: Include all required files ( Dockerfile , version.txt , requirements.txt , etc.) Add or update integration tests following the testing guidelines Update documentation if needed PR validation: The automated CI pipeline will: Run unit and integration tests Validate Docker build process Check code quality and coverage Verify all required files are present Integration tests required If your package doesn't have integration tests, this is the perfect time to add them following the testing toolkit guidelines . The CI pipeline expects comprehensive test coverage for production releases. Step 3: Merge and deploy ¶ Review and approval : Get your PR reviewed and approved Merge to main : Once merged, this automatically triggers: GA image build : Creates production image with semantic version tag Registry publication : Publishes to GitHub Container Registry Deployment preparation : Image becomes available for Argo template updates Final GA image : Your production image will be tagged as: ghcr.io/atlanhq/designation-based-group-provisioning:1.0.0 Step 4: Update Argo templates ¶ After the GA image is built, you need to update your package's Argo workflow template to use the new containerized image. This involves two main changes: Remove the git repository artifact (scripts are now embedded in the Docker image) Update the container configuration to use the new image and module path Example PR : marketplace-packages/pull/18043 Key changes required: ¶ Remove git artifact Update container config Remove scripts repository pull inputs: artifacts: - - name: scripts - path: \"/tmp/marketplace-csa-scripts\" - git: - repo: git@github.com:atlanhq/marketplace-csa-scripts - insecureIgnoreHostKey: true - singleBranch: true - branch: \"main\" - revision: \"main\" - sshPrivateKeySecret: - name: \"git-ssh\" - key: \"private-key\" - name: config path: \"/tmp/config\" # ... other artifacts remain unchanged Update container image and module path container: + image: ghcr.io/atlanhq/designation-based-group-provisioning:1.0.0 imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent env: - name: OAUTHLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT value: \"1\" # ... other env vars remain unchanged - workingDir: \"/tmp/marketplace-csa-scripts\" command: [ \"python\" ] args: - \"-m\" - - \"scripts.designation_based_group_provisioning.main\" + - \"designation_based_group_provisioning.main\" Why these changes are needed: ¶ No more git clone : Scripts are now embedded in the Docker image, eliminating the need to clone the repository at runtime Simplified module path : Direct import from the package directory instead of the nested scripts. path Cleaner execution : Container starts directly in the appropriate working directory ( /app ) Better security : No SSH keys needed for git access during workflow execution Once merged, this will automatically deploy your containerized script across all Atlan tenants via the atlan-update workflow Production deployment complete Your script is now fully containerized and ready for production deployment across all Atlan tenants with: ✅ Consistent execution environment ✅ Proper versioning and rollback capability ✅ Comprehensive testing coverage ✅ Automated CI/CD pipeline integration Best practices for containerized scripts ¶ Development practices ¶ Practice Description 📝 Version management Always update version.txt before creating PRs 🔒 Dependency pinning Use specific version ranges in requirements.txt for stability 🧪 Comprehensive testing Ensure integration tests cover containerized execution paths 📚 Documentation Keep HISTORY.md updated with meaningful change descriptions Security considerations ¶ Security Area Best Practice 🔄 Base image updates Regularly update your base Python image for security patches 🔍 Dependency scanning Monitor for security vulnerabilities in your dependencies 🔐 Secret management Never hardcode secrets in Docker images - use environment variables 🔍 Image scanning Enable container scanning in your CI/CD pipeline 2025-04-28 2025-08-26 Was this page helpful?

Athena assets package crawls Athena assets and publishes them to Atlan for discovery. Direct extraction ¶ Will create a new connection This should only be used to create the workflow the first time. Each time you run this method it will create a new connection and new assets within that connection — which could lead to duplicate assets if you run the workflow this way multiple times with the same settings. Instead, when you want to re-crawl assets, re-run the existing workflow (see Re-run existing workflow below). 4.0.0 To crawl Athena assets directly from Athena: Java Python Kotlin Raw REST API Direct extraction from Athena 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 Workflow athena = AthenaCrawler . iamUserAuth ( // (1) \"production\" , // (2) \"athena.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com\" , // (3) 443 , // (4) \"pEBDcOauyVfCtQacdvJUL\" , // (5) \"eKnUIFK2JvmVO5mruqbxjnzXf\" , // (6) \"s3://bucket/location\" , // (7) \"workgroup\" , // (8) List . of ( client . getRoleCache (). getIdForName ( \"$admin\" )), // (8) null , null , true , // (9) true , // (10) 10000L , // (11) Map . of ( \"AwsDataCatalog\" , List . of ( \"schema_one\" , \"schema_two\" )), // (12) null ); // (13) WorkflowResponse response = athena . run ( client ); // (14) The AthenaCrawler package will create a workflow to crawl assets from Athena. The iamUserAuth() method creates a workflow for crawling assets directly from Athena using IAM-based authentication. You must provide a name for the connection that the Athena assets will exist within. You must provide the hostname of your Athena instance. You must specify the port number of the Athena instance (use 443 for the default). You must provide your IAM access key for accessing Athena. You must provide your IAM secret key for accessing Athena. You must provide an S3 location these IAM credentials can access for storing Athena query results. You must specify at least one connection admin, either: everyone in a role (in this example, all $admin users) a list of groups (names) that will be connection admins a list of users (names) that will be connection admins You can also specify whether to allow queries against these Athena assets (true) or disable all querying to these assets (false). You can also specify whether to allow data in these Athena assets to be previewed (true) or not (false). You can also specify the maximum number of rows you'll allow to be returned from a query against these Athena assets. You can also optionally specify the list of schemas to include in crawling. For Athena assets, this should be specified as a list of schema names provided as the value in a map with the key AwsDataCatalog . (If set to null, all schemas will be crawled.) You can also optionally specify the list of schemas to exclude from crawling. For Athena assets, this should be specified as a list of schema names provided as the value in a map with the key AwsDataCatalog . (If set to null, no schemas will be excluded.) You can then run the workflow using the run() method on the object you've created. Because this operation will execute work in Atlan, you must provide it an AtlanClient through which to connect to the tenant. Workflows run asynchronously Remember that workflows run asynchronously. See the packages and workflows introduction for details on how you can check the status and wait until the workflow has been completed.

See the packages and workflows introduction for details on how you can check the status and wait until the workflow has been completed. Create the workflow via UI only We recommend creating the workflow only via the UI. To rerun an existing workflow, see the steps below. Re-run existing workflow ¶ 4.0.0 To re-run an existing workflow for Athena assets: Java Python Kotlin Raw REST API Re-run existing Athena workflow 1 2 3 4 List < WorkflowSearchResult > existing = WorkflowSearchRequest // (1) . findByType ( client , AthenaCrawler . PREFIX , 5 ); // (2) // Determine which of the results is the Athena workflow you want to re-run... WorkflowRunResponse response = existing . get ( n ). rerun ( client ); // (3) You can search for existing workflows through the WorkflowSearchRequest class. You can find workflows by their type using the findByType() helper method and providing the prefix for one of the packages. In this example, we do so for the AthenaCrawler . (You can also specify the maximum number of resulting workflows you want to retrieve as results.) Once you've found the workflow you want to re-run, you can simply call the rerun() helper method on the workflow search result. The WorkflowRunResponse is just a subtype of WorkflowResponse so has the same helper method to monitor progress of the workflow run. Because this operation will execute work in Atlan, you must provide it an AtlanClient through which to connect to the tenant. Optionally, you can use the rerun(client, true) method with idempotency to avoid re-running a workflow that is already in running or in a pending state. This will return details of the already running workflow if found, and by default, it is set to false Workflows run asynchronously Remember that workflows run asynchronously. See the packages and workflows introduction for details on how you can check the status and wait until the workflow has been completed. Coming soon Re-run existing Athena workflow 1 2 3 4 val existing = WorkflowSearchRequest // (1) . findByType ( client , AthenaCrawler .

See the packages and workflows introduction for details on how you can check the status and wait until the workflow has been completed. Requires multiple steps through the raw REST API Find the existing workflow. Send through the resulting re-run request. POST /api/service/workflows/indexsearch 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 { \"from\" : 0 , \"size\" : 5 , \"query\" : { \"bool\" : { \"filter\" : [ { \"nested\" : { \"path\" : \"metadata\" , \"query\" : { \"prefix\" : { \"metadata.name.keyword\" : { \"value\" : \"atlan-athena\" // (1) } } } } } ] } }, \"sort\" : [ { \"metadata.creationTimestamp\" : { \"nested\" : { \"path\" : \"metadata\" }, \"order\" : \"desc\" } } ], \"track_total_hits\" : true } Searching by the atlan-athena prefix will ensure you only find existing Athena assets workflows. Name of the workflow The name of the workflow will be nested within the _source.metadata.name property of the response object. (Remember since this is a search, there could be multiple results, so you may want to use the other details in each result to determine which workflow you really want.) POST /api/service/workflows/submit 100 101 102 103 104 { \"namespace\" : \"default\" , \"resourceKind\" : \"WorkflowTemplate\" , \"resourceName\" : \"atlan-athena-1684500411\" // (1) } Send the name of the workflow as the resourceName to rerun it. 2022-12-28 2025-01-16 Was this page helpful?

(POST) MongoDB assets package ¶ The MongoDB assets package crawls MongoDB assets and publishes them to Atlan for discovery. Direct extraction ¶ Will create a new connection This should only be used to create the workflow the first time. Each time you run this method it will create a new connection and new assets within that connection — which could lead to duplicate assets if you run the workflow this way multiple times with the same settings. Instead, when you want to re-crawl assets, re-run the existing workflow (see Re-run existing workflow below). 7.0.0 To crawl assets directly from MongoDB: Java Python Kotlin Raw REST API Coming soon Direct extraction from MongoDB 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 from pyatlan.client.atlan import AtlanClient from pyatlan.model.packages import MongoDBCrawler client = AtlanClient () crawler = ( MongoDBCrawler ( # (1) client = client , # (2) connection_name = \"production\" , # (3) admin_roles = [ client . role_cache . get_id_for_name ( \"$admin\" )], # (4) admin_groups = None , admin_users = None , row_limit = 10000 , # (5) allow_query = True , # (6) allow_query_preview = True , # (7) ) . direct ( hostname = \"test.host.mongodb.net\" , port = 27017 ) # (8) . basic_auth ( # (9) username = \"test-user\" , password = \"test-pass\" , native_host = \"test.native.mongodb.net\" , default_db = \"test-default-db\" , auth_db = \"test-auth-db\" , is_ssl = True , ) . include ( assets = [ \"test-asset-1\" , \"test-asset-2\" ]) # (10) . exclude ( assets = [ \"test-asset-1\" , \"test-asset-2\" ]) # (11) . exclude_regex ( regex = \"TEST*\" ) # (12) . to_workflow () # (13) ) response = client . workflow . run ( crawler ) # (14) Base configuration for a new MongoDB crawler. You must provide a client instance. You must provide a name for the connection that the MongoDB assets will exist within. You must specify at least one connection admin , either: everyone in a role (in this example, all $admin users). a list of groups (names) that will be connection admins. a list of users (names) that will be connection admins. You can specify a maximum number of rows that can be accessed for any asset in the connection. defaults to 10000 . You can specify whether you want to allow queries to this connection (default: True , as in this example) or deny all query access to the connection ( False ). You can specify whether you want to allow data previews on this connection (default: True , as in this example) or deny all sample data previews to the connection ( False ). When crawling assets directly from MongoDB, you are required to provide the following information: hostname of the Atlas SQL connection. port number of the Atlas SQL connection. default: 27017 . When using basic authentication, you are required to provide the following information: username through which to access Atlas SQL connection. password through which to access Atlas SQL connection. native host address for the MongoDB connection. default database to connect to. authentication database to use (default: \"admin\" ). whether to use SSL for the connection (default: True ). You can also optionally specify the list of assets to include in crawling. For MongoDB assets, this should be specified as a list of database names. If set to [] , all databases will be crawled. You can also optionally specify the list of assets to exclude from crawling. For MongoDB assets, this should be specified as a list of database GUIDs. If set to [] , no databases will be excluded. You can also optionally specify the exclude regex for the crawler to ignore collections based on a naming convention. Now, you can convert the package into a Workflow object. Run the workflow by invoking the run() method on the workflow client, passing the created object. Workflows run asynchronously Remember that workflows run asynchronously. See the packages and workflows introduction for details on how you can check the status and wait until the workflow has been completed. Coming soon Create the workflow via UI only We recommend creating the workflow only via the UI. To rerun an existing workflow, see the steps below. Re-run existing workflow ¶ 4.0.0 To re-run an existing workflow for MongoDB assets: Java Python Kotlin Raw REST API Coming soon Re-run existing MongoDB workflow 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 from pyatlan.client.atlan import AtlanClient from pyatlan.model.enums import WorkflowPackage client = AtlanClient () existing = client . workflow . find_by_type ( # (1) prefix = WorkflowPackage . MONGODB , max_results = 5 ) # Determine which MongoDB workflow (n) # from the list of results you want to re-run. response = client . workflow . rerun ( existing [ n ]) # (2) You can find workflows by their type using the workflow client find_by_type() method and providing the prefix for one of the packages. In this example, we do so for the MongoDBCrawler . (You can also specify the maximum number of resulting workflows you want to retrieve as results.) Once you've found the workflow you want to re-run, you can simply call the workflow client rerun() method. Optionally, you can use rerun(idempotent=True) to avoid re-running a workflow that is already in running or in a pending state. This will return details of the already running workflow if found, and by default, it is set to False . Workflows run asynchronously Remember that workflows run asynchronously. See the packages and workflows introduction for details on how you can check the status and wait until the workflow has been completed. Coming soon Requires multiple steps through the raw REST API Find the existing workflow. Send through the resulting re-run request. POST /api/service/workflows/indexsearch 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 { \"from\" : 0 , \"size\" : 5 , \"query\" : { \"bool\" : { \"filter\" : [ { \"nested\" : { \"path\" : \"metadata\" , \"query\" : { \"prefix\" : { \"metadata.name.keyword\" : { \"value\" : \"atlan-mongodb\" // (1) } } } } } ] } }, \"sort\" : [ { \"metadata.creationTimestamp\" : { \"nested\" : { \"path\" : \"metadata\" }, \"order\" : \"desc\" } } ], \"track_total_hits\" : true } Searching by the atlan-mongodb prefix will ensure you only find existing MongoDB assets workflows. Name of the workflow The name of the workflow will be nested within the _source.metadata.name property of the response object. (Remember since this is a search, there could be multiple results, so you may want to use the other details in each result to determine which workflow you really want.) POST /api/service/workflows/submit 100 101 102 103 104 { \"namespace\" : \"default\" , \"resourceKind\" : \"WorkflowTemplate\" , \"resourceName\" : \"atlan-mongodb-1684500411\" // (1) } Send the name of the workflow as the resourceName to rerun it. 2025-01-07 2025-06-11 Was this page helpful?

Build minimal object needed Create the asset from the object (Optional) Enrich before creating /api/meta/entity/bulk (POST) Creating an asset ¶ All objects in the SDK that you can create within Atlan implement the builder pattern. This allows you to progressively build-up the object you want to create. In addition, each object provides a method that takes the minimal set of required fields to create that asset . Each type of asset has a different containment hierarchy Every asset in Atlan can have slightly different parent objects in which they exist. For example, a GlossaryTerm cannot exist outside a Glossary . A Column cannot exist outside a Table , View or MaterializedView ; these cannot exist outside a Schema ; which cannot exist outside a Database ; which cannot exist outside a Connection . The minimal required fields for each asset type will therefore be slightly different. Creation order is important As a result of this containment, creation order is important. Parent objects must be created (exist) before child objects can be created. Build minimal object needed ¶ 2.0.0 1.0.0 For example, to create a glossary term you need to provide the name of the term and either the GUID or qualifiedName of the glossary in which to create the term: Java Python Kotlin Raw REST API Build minimal asset necessary for creation 1 2 3 GlossaryTermBuilder <? , ?> termCreator = GlossaryTerm . creator ( \"Example Term\" , // (1) \"b4113341-251b-4adc-81fb-2420501c30e6\" ); // (2) A name for the new term. The GUID or qualifiedName of the glossary in which to create the term. Build minimal asset necessary for creation 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 from pyatlan.client.atlan import AtlanClient from pyatlan.model.assets import AtlasGlossaryTerm client = AtlanClient () term = AtlasGlossaryTerm . creator ( name = \"Example Term\" , # (1) glossary_guid = \"b4113341-251b-4adc-81fb-2420501c30e6\" # (2) ) A name for the new term. The GUID of the glossary in which to create the term. Build minimal asset necessary for creation 1 2 3 4 5 val termCreator = GlossaryTerm . creator ( \"Example Term\" , // (1) \"b4113341-251b-4adc-81fb-2420501c30e6\" , // (2) ) A name for the new term. The GUID or qualifiedName of the glossary in which to create the term. Implicit in the API calls below There is nothing specific to do for this step when using the raw APIs — constructing the object is simply what you place in the payload of the API calls in the steps below. Create the asset from the object ¶ 1.4.0 4.0.0 This term object will have the minimal required information for Atlan to create it. You must then actually persist the object in Atlan 1 : Java Python Kotlin Raw REST API Create the asset 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 GlossaryTerm term = termCreator . build (); // (1) AssetMutationResponse response = term . save ( client ); // (2) Asset created = response . getCreatedAssets (). get ( 0 ); // (3) if ( created instanceof GlossaryTerm ) { term = ( GlossaryTerm ) created ; // (4) } Asset updated = response . getUpdatedAssets (). get ( 0 ); // (5) Glossary glossary ; if ( updated instanceof Glossary ) { glossary = ( Glossary ) updated ; // (6) } Before you can take actions on the builder object you've been interacting with, you need to build() it into a full object. Then you can do operations, like save() , which will either: create a new asset, if Atlan does not have a term with the same name in the same glossary update an existing asset, if Atlan already has a term with the same name in the same glossary Because this operation will persist the asset in Atlan, you must provide it an AtlanClient through which to connect to the tenant. You can distinguish what was created or updated: getCreatedAssets() lists assets that were created getUpdatedAssets() lists assets that were updated Note that the save() method always returns objects of type Asset , though. The Asset class is a superclass of all assets. So you need to cast to more specific types (like GlossaryTerm ) after verifying the object that was actually returned. In this example, creating the GlossaryTerm actually also updates the parent Glossary . This is why the response contains generic Asset objects rather than specific types — any operation could side-effect a number of different assets. Like with the GlossaryTerm , you can check and cast the generic Asset returned by the response into its more specific type ( Glossary ). Create the asset 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 response = client . asset . save ( term ) # (1) created = response . assets_created ( asset_type = AtlasGlossaryTerm ) # (2) if created : # (3) term = created [ 0 ] # (4) updated = response . assets_updated ( asset_type = AtlasGlossaryTerm ) # (5) if updated : # (6) term = updated [ 0 ] # (7) Call the save method which will create or update the asset in atlan. You can distinguish what was created or updated: assets_created(asset_type=AtlasGlossaryTerm) returns a lists assets of the specified type that were created. assets_updated(asset_type=AtlasGlossaryTerm) returns a lists assets of the specified type that were updated. Check if the list is empty to determine if an AtlasGlossaryTerm was created. Get the new AtlasGlossaryTerm that was created. In this example, creating the AtlasGlossaryTerm actually also updates the parent AtlasGlossary . This is why the response contains an AtlasGlossary . Check if the list is empty to determine if an AtlasGlossary was updated. Get the AtlasGlossary that was updated. Create the asset 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 var term = termCreator . build () // (1) val response = term . save ( client ) // (2) val created = response . createdAssets [ 0 ] // (3) if ( created is GlossaryTerm ) { term = created // (4) } val updated = response . updatedAssets [ 0 ] // (5) val glossary = if ( updated is Glossary ) updated else null // (6) Before you can take actions on the builder object you've been interacting with, you need to build() it into a full object. Then you can do operations, like save() , which will either: create a new asset, if Atlan does not have a term with the same name in the same glossary update an existing asset, if Atlan already has a term with the same name in the same glossary Because this operation will persist the asset in Atlan, you must provide it an AtlanClient through which to connect to the tenant.

The Asset class is a superclass of all assets. So you need to cast to more specific types (like GlossaryTerm ) after verifying the object that was actually returned. In this example, creating the GlossaryTerm actually also updates the parent Glossary . This is why the response contains generic Asset objects rather than specific types — any operation could side-effect a number of different assets. Like with the GlossaryTerm , you can check and cast the generic Asset returned by the response into its more specific type ( Glossary ). POST /api/meta/entity/bulk 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 { \"entities\" : [ // (1) { \"typeName\" : \"AtlasGlossaryTerm\" , // (2) \"attributes\" : { \"name\" : \"Example Term\" , // (3) \"qualifiedName\" : \"Example Term\" , // (4) \"anchor\" : { // (5) \"typeName\" : \"AtlasGlossary\" , \"guid\" : \"b4113341-251b-4adc-81fb-2420501c30e6\" } } } ] } All assets must be wrapped in an entities array. You must provide the exact type name for the asset (case-sensitive). For a term, this is AtlasGlossaryTerm . You must provide the exact name of the asset (case-sensitive). You must provide a qualifiedName of the asset (case-sensitive). In the case of glossary objects (like terms), this will actually be replaced in the back-end with a generated qualifiedName , but you must provide some value when creating the object. You must also specify the parent object in which this object is contained (if any). In the case of a term, it can only exist within a glossary. So here we specify the details of the parent glossary through the anchor relationship (specific to glossary assets). (Optional) Enrich before creating ¶ 2.0.0 4.0.0 If you want to further enrich the asset before creating it, you can do this using the builder pattern: Java Python Kotlin Raw REST API Alternatively, further enrich the asset before creating it 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 GlossaryTerm term = termCreator // (1) . certificateStatus ( CertificateStatus . VERIFIED ) // (2) . announcementType ( AtlanAnnouncementType . INFORMATION ) . announcementTitle ( \"Imported\" ) . announcementMessage ( \"This term was imported from ...\" ) . build (); // (3) AssetMutationResponse response = term . save ( client ); // (4) We'll create an object you can take actions on from this creator. In this example, you're adding a certificate and announcement to the object. To persist the enrichment back to the object, you must build() the builder. You can call the save() operation against this enriched object, the same as shown earlier. Because this operation will persist the asset in Atlan, you must provide it an AtlanClient through which to connect to the tenant. Assign the result back Remember to assign the result of the build() operation back to a variable! (In the example above this happens on line 5 with GlossaryTerm term = .) Alternatively, further enrich the asset before creating it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 from pyatlan.client.atlan import AtlanClient from pyatlan.model.assets import AtlasGlossary , AtlasGlossaryTerm from pyatlan.model.enums import AnnouncementType , CertificateStatus client = AtlanClient () term = AtlasGlossaryTerm . creator ( name = \"Example Term\" , glossary_guid = \"b4113341-251b-4adc-81fb-2420501c30e6\" ) term . certificate_status = CertificateStatus . VERIFIED announcement = Announcement ( announcement_type = AnnouncementType . INFORMATION , announcement_title = \"Imported\" , announcement_message = \"This term was imported from ..\" , ) term . set_announcement ( announcement ) response = client . asset . save ( term ) # (1) You can call the save() operation against this enriched object, the same as shown earlier. Alternatively, further enrich the asset before creating it 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 val term = termCreator // (1) . certificateStatus ( CertificateStatus . VERIFIED ) // (2) . announcementType ( AtlanAnnouncementType . INFORMATION ) . announcementTitle ( \"Imported\" ) . announcementMessage ( \"This term was imported from ...\" ) . build () // (3) val response = term . save ( client ) // (4) We'll create an object you can take actions on from this creator. In this example, you're adding a certificate and announcement to the object. To persist the enrichment back to the object, you must build() the builder. You can call the save() operation against this enriched object, the same as shown earlier. Because this operation will persist the asset in Atlan, you must provide it an AtlanClient through which to connect to the tenant. Assign the result back Remember to assign the result of the build() operation back to a variable! (In the example above this happens on line 6 with val term = .) POST /api/meta/entity/bulk 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 { \"entities\" : [ // (1) { \"typeName\" : \"AtlasGlossaryTerm\" , \"attributes\" : { \"name\" : \"Example Term\" , \"qualifiedName\" : \"Example Term\" , \"anchor\" : { \"typeName\" : \"AtlasGlossary\" , \"guid\" : \"b4113341-251b-4adc-81fb-2420501c30e6\" }, \"certificateStatus\" : \"VERIFIED\" , // (2) \"announcementType\" : \"information\" , \"announcementTitle\" : \"Imported\" , \"announcementMessage\" : \"This term was imported from...\" } } ] } You would still create the asset by wrapping it within the entities array. But you can also extend the information you store on the asset. In this example, you're adding a certificate and announcement to the object when it is created. Why no distinction between creation and update? This has to do with how Atlan detects changes — see the Importance of identifiers for a more detailed explanation. ↩ 2022-09-14 2024-12-11 Was this page helpful? Thanks for your feedback!

It is a named view of data that references or points to the data you want to use in activities. Complete reference This is a complete reference for the AdfDataset object in Atlan, showing every possible property and relationship that can exist for these objects. For an introduction, you probably want to start with: Snippets — small, atomic examples of single-step use cases. Patterns — walkthroughs of common multi-step implementation patterns. AdfDataset inherits its attributes and relationships from these other types: classDiagram direction RL class AdfDataset link AdfDataset \"../adfdataset\" class ADF { <<abstract>> } link ADF \"../adf\" ADF <|-- AdfDataset : extends class Catalog { <<abstract>> } link Catalog \"../catalog\" Catalog <|-- ADF : extends class Asset { <<abstract>> } link Asset \"../asset\" Asset <|-- Catalog : extends class Referenceable { <<abstract>> } link Referenceable \"../referenceable\" Referenceable <|-- Asset : extends Properties ¶ Inherited properties These attributes are inherited from AdfDataset 's supertypes (shown above): typeName ¶ Type of this asset. guid ¶ Globally-unique identifier for this asset. classifications ¶ Tags assigned to the asset.

Relationships with attribute support Add user-defined relationship Remove user-defined relationship Retrieve user-defined relationship /api/meta/entity/bulk (POST) Manage asset relationships with attributes ¶ Atlan supports relationships between assets that can include attributes, similar to how assets themselves have attributes. These relationship-level attributes provide additional context and metadata about the connection between assets. The SDK enables you to create, retrieve, and delete these attributed relationships programmatically. Relationships with attribute support ¶ The following relationship types support attributes that you can set via the SDK: Available attributed relationships AtlasGlossaryAntonym AtlasGlossarySynonym AtlasGlossaryReplacementTerm AtlasGlossarySemanticAssignment AtlasGlossaryPreferredTerm AtlasGlossaryRelatedTerm AtlasGlossaryTermCategorization AtlasGlossaryTranslation AtlasGlossaryValidValue AtlasGlossaryIsARelationship CustomParentEntityCustomChildEntities CustomRelatedFromEntitiesCustomRelatedToEntities UserDefRelationship Add user-defined relationship ¶ 7.1.0 This example demonstrates how to add UserDefRelationship between glossary terms. While this relationship type is currently visible in the Atlan UI for glossary terms, you can create any other supported relationship types that have attributes ( as listed above ) between any asset types using similar steps shown in the snippet below. All these relationships will be persisted in the backend (metastore) even if they're not currently visible in the Atlan UI. Python Java Raw REST API Add user-defined relationship between terms 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 from pyatlan.client.atlan import AtlanClient from pyatlan.model.assets import AtlasGlossaryTerm from pyatlan.model.assets.relations import UserDefRelationship client = AtlanClient () # Create updater for the source term term1_to_update = AtlasGlossaryTerm . updater ( # (1) qualified_name = \"FpWBfqOfP0qZQ6tCpK10n@nrrnNyRABZTc6CEKwHh73\" , name = \"Policy\" , glossary_guid = \"55aaaa56-d8cd-4f19-8026-10d511a9b071\" ) # Create reference to the target term term2 = AtlasGlossaryTerm . ref_by_guid ( \"f558a01a-2e16-440c-ba2d-fed2099e540a\" ) # (2) # Create the user-defined relationship with attributes udr = UserDefRelationship ( # (3) from_type_label = \"Sold by\" , to_type_label = \"Sells\" ) # Build and assign the relationship term1_to_update . user_def_relationship_to = [ # (4) udr . user_def_relationship_to ( term2 ) ] # Save the relationship response = client . asset . save ( term1_to_update ) # (5) Create an updater for the source term using .updater() with the qualified_name , name , and glossary_guid of the term you want to add the relationship to. Create a reference to the target term using ref_by_guid() or ref_by_qualified_name() . Define the relationship by creating a UserDefRelationship object with attributes like from_type_label and to_type_label . Build the relationship using the user_def_relationship_to() method and assign it to the user_def_relationship_to attribute. Save the changes using client.asset.save() to persist the relationship in Atlan.

Reference the target asset: Create a reference to the target term using its guid . Define relationship attributes: Provide the necessary attributes for the UserDefRelationship , including toTypeLabel and fromTypeLabel . Relationship visibility User-defined relationships between glossary terms are visible in the Atlan UI. For other asset types, relationships are stored in the backend but may not be visible in the UI until support is added. Remove user-defined relationship ¶ 7.1.0 This example demonstrates how to remove UserDefRelationship between glossary terms. You can use the same approach to remove any attributed relationship type ( as listed above ) between any asset types using the steps shown in the snippet below. Python Java Raw REST API Remove user-defined relationship between terms 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 from pyatlan.client.atlan import AtlanClient from pyatlan.model.assets import AtlasGlossaryTerm client = AtlanClient () # Create updater for the source term term1_to_update = AtlasGlossaryTerm . updater ( # (1) qualified_name = \"FpWBfqOfP0qZQ6tCpK10n@nrrnNyRABZTc6CEKwHh73\" , name = \"Policy\" , glossary_guid = \"55aaaa56-d8cd-4f19-8026-10d511a9b071\" ) # Remove all outgoing relationships by setting to empty list term1_to_update . user_def_relationship_to = [] # (2) # Save the changes to remove the relationship response = client . asset . save ( term1_to_update ) # (3) Create an updater for the source term using .updater() with the qualified_name , name , and glossary_guid of the term you want to remove relationships from. Clear relationships by assigning an empty list [] to user_def_relationship_to to remove all existing outgoing relationships. Save the changes using client.asset.save() to persist the removal in Atlan. Coming soon POST /api/meta/entity/bulk 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 { \"entities\" : [ { \"typeName\" : \"AtlasGlossaryTerm\" , \"attributes\" : { \"anchor\" : { // (1) \"typeName\" : \"AtlasGlossary\" , \"guid\" : \"55aaaa56-d8cd-4f19-8026-10d511a9b071\" }, \"name\" : \"Policy\" , \"qualifiedName\" : \"FpWBfqOfP0qZQ6tCpK10n@nrrnNyRABZTc6CEKwHh73\" , \"userDefRelationshipTo\" : [] // (2) } } ] } Provide source asset details: Include the required attributes name , qualifiedName , and glossary guid for the term you want to add the relationship to. Clear relationships by assigning an empty array [] to userDefRelationshipTo to remove all existing outgoing relationships. Complete removal Setting user_def_relationship_to = [] removes all outgoing user-defined relationships from the asset. To remove only specific relationships while keeping others, you would need to retrieve the existing relationships first and reconstruct the list without the unwanted ones. Retrieve user-defined relationship ¶ 7.1.0 This example demonstrates how to retrieve UserDefRelationship between glossary terms. You can use the same approach to retrieve any attributed relationship type ( as listed above ) between any asset types. While UserDefRelationship is visible in the UI for glossary terms, all relationships are persisted in the backend regardless of UI visibility.

most of the write operations covered in the above sections, you can also: Combine multiple operations together Make changes to multiple assets at the same time Optimize changes These each allow you to optimize your work. Rather than making a separate API call for each change or each asset, you can make a single API call that includes all your changes — even across many assets. Of course, in order to change multiple assets you also need to first know which assets to change. To do this, there is a common end-to-end bulk update pattern you can follow. 2023-04-12 2024-04-22 Was this page helpful? Thanks for your feedback! Thanks for your feedback!

Change an existing asset Remove from an existing asset When creating an asset /api/meta/entity/bulk (POST) Change description ¶ There are actually two descriptions per asset There are actually two fields in Atlan that capture the description of an asset: description and userDescription . In the UI, userDescription will take precedence. This is the field that is updated when a user updates the description through the UI. When a system updates a description, it will populate the description field. This field is only shown in the UI when the userDescription field is empty. The examples below therefore all update the description field, to allow a user to still override this value through the UI. If you want to actually override any users' descriptions, however, replace description in the examples below with userDescription . Change an existing asset ¶ Could create a new asset Remember that Atlan matches the provided qualifiedName to determine whether to update or create the asset . 2.0.0 4.0.0 To change a description on an existing asset : dbt Java Python Kotlin Raw REST API Change description on existing asset 1 2 3 4 models : - name : TOP_BEVERAGE_USERS # (1) description : >- # (2) My new description You must of course give the name of the object. You just use the normal dbt description field to provide a description — no need for the meta . atlan . attributes structure. Change description on existing asset 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Table table = Table . updater ( // (1) \"default/snowflake/1657037873/SAMPLE_DB/FOOD_BEV/TOP_BEVERAGE_USERS\" , // (2) \"TOP_BEVERAGE_USERS\" ) // (3) . description ( \"My new description\" ) // (4) . build (); // (5) AssetMutationResponse response = table . save ( client ); // (6) assert response . getUpdatedAssets (). size () == 1 // (7) Use the updater() helper method to create the minimal object necessary to do an update. The qualifiedName of the object. The name of the object. Provide the new description. Build the updater into an object. Send the update to Atlan. Because this operation will persist the asset in Atlan, you must provide it an AtlanClient through which to connect to the tenant. The response will include that single asset that was updated. Change description on existing an asset 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 from pyatlan.client.atlan import AtlanClient from pyatlan.model.assets import Table client = AtlanClient () table = Table . updater ( # (1) qualified_name = \"default/snowflake/1657037873/SAMPLE_DB/FOOD_BEV/TOP_BEVERAGE_USERS\" , name = \"TOP_BEVERAGE_USERS\" , ) table . description = \"My new description\" # (2) response = client . asset . save ( table ) # (3) assert 1 == len ( response . assets_updated ( asset_type = Table )) # (4) Use the updater() method to create an asset suitable for modification i.e. with all the requisite attributes. Provide the new description. Send the update to Atlan. The response should only include that single asset that was updated. Change description on existing asset 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 val table = Table . updater ( // (1) \"default/snowflake/1657037873/SAMPLE_DB/FOOD_BEV/TOP_BEVERAGE_USERS\" , // (2) \"TOP_BEVERAGE_USERS\" ) // (3) . description ( \"My new description\" ) // (4) . build () // (5) val response = table . save ( client ) // (6) assert ( response . updatedAssets . size == 1 ) // (7) Use the updater() helper method to create the minimal object necessary to do an update. The qualifiedName of the object. The name of the object. Provide the new description. Build the updater into an object. Send the update to Atlan. Because this operation will persist the asset in Atlan, you must provide it an AtlanClient through which to connect to the tenant. The response will include that single asset that was updated. POST /api/meta/entity/bulk 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 { \"entities\" : [ // (1) { \"typeName\" : \"Table\" , // (2) \"attributes\" : { \"name\" : \"TOP_BEVERAGE_USERS\" , // (3) \"qualifiedName\" : \"default/snowflake/1657037873/SAMPLE_DB/FOOD_BEV/TOP_BEVERAGE_USERS\" , // (4) \"description\" : \"My new description\" // (5) } } ] } All assets must be wrapped in an entities array. You must provide the exact type name for the asset (case-sensitive). You must provide the exact name of the asset (case-sensitive). You must provide the exact qualifiedName of the asset (case-sensitive). Provide the new description. Remove from an existing asset ¶ 2.0.0 4.0.0 To remove a description from an existing asset: dbt Java Python Kotlin Raw REST API It is currently not possible to remove a description from an asset via dbt. Remove description from existing asset 1 2 3 4 Table table = Table . removeDescription ( // (1) client , // (2) \"default/snowflake/1657037873/SAMPLE_DB/FOOD_BEV/TOP_BEVERAGE_USERS\" , // (3) \"TOP_BEVERAGE_USERS\" ); // (4) Use the removeDescription() helper method, which for most objects requires a minimal set of information. This helper method will construct the necessary request, call the necessary API(s), and return with the result of the removal operation all-in-one. Because this operation will directly change the asset in Atlan, you must provide it an AtlanClient through which to connect to the tenant. The qualifiedName of the object. The name of the object. Remove description from an existing asset 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 from pyatlan.client.atlan import AtlanClient from pyatlan.model.assets import Table client = AtlanClient () table = Table . updater ( # (1) qualified_name = \"default/snowflake/1657037873/SAMPLE_DB/FOOD_BEV/TOP_BEVERAGE_USERS\" , name = \"TOP_BEVERAGE_USERS\" , ) table . description = None # (2) response = client . asset . save ( table ) # (3) assert 1 == len ( response . assets_updated ( asset_type = Table )) # (4) Use the updater() method to create an asset suitable for modification i.e. with all the requisite attributes. Set the description to None . Send the update to Atlan.

You must provide the exact type name for the asset (case-sensitive). You must provide the exact name of the asset (case-sensitive). You must provide the exact qualifiedName of the asset (case-sensitive). You must set the description to null . When creating an asset ¶ 2.0.0 4.0.0 To add a description when creating an asset: dbt Java Python Kotlin Raw REST API Add description when creating an asset 1 2 3 4 models : - name : TOP_BEVERAGE_USERS # (1) description : >- # (2) My description of the asset You must of course give the name of the object. You just use the normal dbt description field to provide a description — no need for the meta . atlan . attributes structure.

Set the description that should be added. Call the build() method to build the enriched object. Call the save() method to actually create the asset with this description. Because this operation will persist the asset in Atlan, you must provide it an AtlanClient through which to connect to the tenant. The response will include that single asset that was created.

Set the description. Call the save() method to actually create the asset with these owners. Since a save can add, update, delete or partially update multiple assets the assets_created() method can be used to return a list of the assets of the specified type that were added. The assert statement is present to ensure a Table asset was created. Since only one Table has been created we use an index of 0 to retrieve the newly created table.

You must provide the exact type name for the asset (case-sensitive). You must provide a name for the asset. In the case of a table, the qualifiedName must be the concatenation of the parent schema's qualifiedName and the name of the table. When creating a table, you must specify the schema to create it within. This is defined by the atlanSchema attribute. You must specify both the type (must be Schema ) and qualifiedName of the schema within the atlanSchema attribute — and the schema must already exist.
