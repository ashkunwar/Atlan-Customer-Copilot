- **Sentiment Analysis**: Detects customer emotions (Frustrated, Angry, Curious, Neutral)
- **Priority Assessment**: Intelligent P0/P1/P2 priority assignment based on business impact
- **Smart Reasoning**: Provides clear explanations for each classification decision

### 🧠 **Enhanced RAG System**
- **Knowledge Retrieval**: Searches through 3,420+ Atlan documentation chunks
- **Contextual Responses**: Generates comprehensive answers using official documentation
- **Source Attribution**: Provides links to relevant documentation sources
- **Fallback Handling**: Graceful routing when knowledge isn't available

### 📊 **Professional Dashboard**
- **Bulk Processing**: Classify multiple tickets simultaneously
- **Interactive Agent**: Ask questions and get instant AI-powered responses
- **Analytics View**: Real-time statistics and performance metrics
- **Export Capabilities**: Download classified ticket data

- **Supported Topics**: 15+ business areas (API, Connectors, Security, etc.)

## 🎯 Use Cases

### **Immediate Business Impact**
1. **Automated Triage**: Instantly identify P0 production issues vs. P2 documentation requests
2. **Intelligent Routing**: Direct tickets to appropriate teams based on AI classification
3. **Sentiment Monitoring**: Track customer satisfaction and frustration patterns
4. **Knowledge Automation**: Provide instant answers to common questions

### **Sample Classifications**

```
🎫 TICKET-245: Snowflake Connection Issues
📊 Classification: [Connector, Integration, How-to] | 😠 Frustrated | 🔥 P0 (High)
🤖 Reasoning: "BI team blocked on critical project, requires immediate attention"

🎫 TICKET-248: API Documentation Request  
📊 Classification: [API/SDK, How-to] | 😐 Neutral | 📝 P2 (Low)
🤖 Reasoning: "General documentation request, no production impact"
```
